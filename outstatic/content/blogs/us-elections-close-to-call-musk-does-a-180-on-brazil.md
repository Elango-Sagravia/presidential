### US Election the Closest Race Since 1960

The 2024 presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is the closest in over 60 years, with neither candidate leading by more than 5 points in [national polls](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4x71znwxdo). Harris holds a slim 3-point edge on average but faces challenges in the Electoral College. She leads slightly in battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, while Trump is ahead in Arizona and Georgia. Nevada, where polls show a near tie, could decide the outcome.

In a [surprising twist](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj9ekdvxx2o), Trump announced that this would be his final campaign, stating that he would not run in 2028 if he lost. With six weeks left until the election and margins so narrow, the race remains too close to call, and even small shifts could determine the winner.

### Musk Complies with Brazilian Court

​​Elon Musk’s X will now comply with court demands in Brazil to resume operations and potentially resolve disputes over [free speech](https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1829296715989414281) and misinformation. After X was shut down in late August, the Brazilian Supreme Court requested documents to validate its new legal representative for failing to address hate speech moderation orders.

Recently, X [announced](https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1836567745229365552) it has legal representation to meet an essential requirement. The court has given X five days to provide the necessary documentation. Brazilian law mandates foreign companies to have a local representative. To lift the ban, X must also block certain accounts linked to hate speech investigations and pay over $3 million in fines.

### Switzerland Votes Against Biodiversity Protection

Swiss voters recently [rejected](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/22/referendum-underway-on-whether-to-boost-switzerlands-biodiversity) a proposal to boost biodiversity protection, with 66.6% voting against it. The plan aimed to increase funding for preserving natural spaces and limit development in protected areas. Still, opponents, including the government, said it was too expensive and would hurt economic growth, with 630 million euros already spent on biodiversity efforts each year. They also worried it would restrict energy production, tourism, and farming.

Supporters argued that protecting wildlife and green spaces is crucial, especially as many species in Switzerland are endangered. They believe more protected areas would benefit tourism and local economies. Despite its stunning landscapes, Switzerland ranks among the countries with the highest rates of threatened species. This vote was part of the country’s regular referendum process.

### France Sends Riot Police to Martinique

France has sent elite anti-riot police to Martinique for the first time in 65 years following violent protests over the high cost of living. The government had banned protests and imposed a curfew in several municipalities after clashes left six police officers and one civilian injured despite the predominately peaceful protests continued over the weekend, with thousands marching.

The [anti-riot unit](https://www.voanews.com/a/long-forbidden-french-anti-riot-force-sent-to-martinique-as-thousands-defy-bans-on-protests/7794186.html), previously banned in Martinique after deadly protests in 1959, arrived to help restore order. Critics, like local politician Beatrice Bellay, argue that deploying the force worsens tensions and distracts from addressing the island’s legitimate social concerns. France has not had an easy time with some of its dependent territories. Another French territory, New Caledonia in the Pacific, has had an uptick in clashes this year [(see previous issue)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/20th-sept-french-security-forces-kill-2-fbi-disrupts-chinese-hackers).

### German Far-Right Party Doesn’t Get Projected Win

Germany's center-left SPD made a surprising comeback in Sunday’s regional elections in Brandenburg, winning 30.9% of the vote despite earlier polling at just 20%. This victory puts them ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which received 29.2% and has seen a 5.7% increase since the last election five years ago [(see previous issue)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/quad-summit-new-french-government).

The AfD had been leading the polls for two years and recently became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since WWII, taking the top spot in Thuringia earlier this month. The AfD's rise is attributed to growing voter dissatisfaction over issues like the cost of living, immigration, and the war in Ukraine. However, the next difficulty the SPD party will encounter is finding a party to form a coalition within the regional government. The populist left (BSW) and center-right party (CDU) are both uninterested.
