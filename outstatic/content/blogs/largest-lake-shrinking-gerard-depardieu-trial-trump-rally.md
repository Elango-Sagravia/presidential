### Caspian Sea crisis

![Caspian Sea faces a crisis from climate change and pollution, with activists documenting its shrinking shores and ecological decline](/images/the-planet-s-largest-lake-is-shrinking-fast-E1Nj.webp)

The Caspian Sea is facing a crisis due to [climate change](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/24/climate/caspian-sea-shrinking-pollution/index.html), water over-extraction, and pollution, which negatively impact its ecology and local communities. Eco-activists, such as Kazakhstan’s Azamat Sarsenbayev and Iran’s Khashayar Javanmardi, are [documenting](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/13/the-big-picture-khashayar-javanmardi-explores-the-decline-of-the-caspian-sea) the sea’s shrinking shores and increasing pollution levels. With diminishing river flows, high evaporation rates, and rising temperatures, the Caspian's water levels are projected to drop by up to 98 feet by 2100.

The decline of these ecosystems threatens neighboring countries' environment and economic stability. Urgent collaborative action is necessary to prevent a disaster similar to the collapse of the [Aral Sea](https://earth.org/the-aral-sea-catastrophe-understanding-one-of-the-worst-ecological-calamities-of-the-last-century/), although achieving this cooperation will be challenging. The Caspian Sea is a base for the [Russian navy](https://www.intellinews.com/ukraine-war-makes-caspian-sea-environmental-crisis-worse-335432/), and military activity since the Ukraine war has accelerated ecological issues.

### **Depardieu on trial**

![Gérard Depardieu's criminal trial begins in absentia over assault allegations](/images/famous-french-actor-gerard-depadiu-faces-charges-QyOD.webp)

Gerard Depardieu’s [criminal trial](https://www.dw.com/en/french-actor-gerard-depardieu-faces-sexual-assault-trial/a-70616042) began in his absence due to health issues. He faces allegations of assaulting two women on the set of *Les* *Volets Verts* in 2021, involving “violence and coercion” and inappropriate conduct. The iconic French actor [denies the accusations](https://www.dw.com/en/french-film-star-gerard-depardieu-rejects-rape-claims/a-45298304). Protesters outside the court are calling for justice, highlighting ongoing issues of sexual misconduct in France’s film industry amid a delayed [#MeToo](https://metoomvmt.org/) movement.

In addition to this case, Depardieu faces around [20 other allegations](https://www.dw.com/en/french-actor-gerard-depardieus-sexual-assault-trial-delayed/a-70616042) of sexual offenses, including reopened rape claims by actress Charlotte Arnould from 2018. The French [film industry’s response](https://www.dw.com/en/50-french-stars-deplore-lynching-of-gerard-depardieu/a-67826617) has been divided, with celebrities defending him publicly, but the proceedings indicate a significant shift toward addressing sexual violence in high-profile sectors. This trial can set a precedent in how France deals with allegations against powerful figures.

### Trump rally fallout

Trump’s recent [campaign rally](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/donald-trump-madison-square-garden-rally/) in New York at Madison Square Garden drew thousands of supporters but faced backlash over inflammatory remarks by speakers, including comedian [Tony Hinchcliffe](https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/who-is-tony-hinchcliffe-the-comedian-who-called-puerto-rico-floating-garbage), who made offensive jokes about Puerto Ricans and other groups. It drew some bipartisan criticism even from GOP leaders, including Rep. Anthony D’Esposito and Mayor Eric Adams, who condemned the language used by some speakers. Trump focused his speech on familiar campaign themes and high-profile figures such as his wife, Melania Trump [(hear full speech)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxlwmpQOSrw), who has been somewhat absent from his campaign this election.

A Trump campaign adviser [distanced](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4956733-trump-campaign-hinchcliffe-puerto-rico-comments-rally/) the former president from controversial remarks made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at a recent New York rally. Campaign adviser Danielle Alvarez clarified that the joke did not represent Trump’s views. The incident drew further attention given Vice President Harris’s simultaneous [outreach](https://lailluminator.com/2024/10/28/harris-puerto-rico/) to Puerto Rican voters, a key demographic in battleground states like Pennsylvania.
