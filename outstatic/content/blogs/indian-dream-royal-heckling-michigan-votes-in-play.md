### Indians Risking It All

![Young Indian migrants risk dangerous journeys to the U.S. in pursuit of the American Dream](/images/young-indians-are-starting-to-show-up-at-the-us-border-to-chase-the-american-dream--1--E1MD.webp)

Young and educated Indians are increasingly willing to [go to extreme lengths](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/22/india/young-indians-chase-american-dream-intl-hnk-dst/index.html) in pursuit of a better life, often choosing dangerous and illegal migration routes to the United States. A growing trend involves these migrants documenting their perilous journeys on social media platforms, presenting a romanticized view of the American Dream. This has become a notable aspect of the broader narrative surrounding illegal immigration.

More Indian nationals are showing up at the [US-Mexico border](https://www.statista.com/chart/33134/reported-number-of-us-customs-border-protection-encounters-with-indian-nationals/#:~:text=Data%20from%20U.S.%20Customs%20and,also%20stopped%20at%20the%20northern%5C) to seek asylum. Many cite that they lack jobs and opportunities, while others give political reasons. In 2024, just under half of the Indian requests for asylum were granted. The Biden administration has made some [border crackdowns](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-administration-toughens-asylum-restrictions-at-border), but many are still willing to take the risk and pay up to $50,000 to make it happen.

### Senator Heckles King Charles

![King Charles faces protest from Senator Lidia Thorpe during his Parliament address](/images/indigenous-senator-heckles-king-charles-in-australia--1--UwND.webp)

Australian Senator Lidia Thorpe’s [heckling of King Charles](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79n20r750po) during his Parliament address has rehashed some recent discussions about Indigenous rights and colonial injustices. Thorpe accused the King of genocide and asserted he did not belong to the land, reflecting deep-seated tensions around Australia’s colonial history. Reactions to her protest were mixed. Read more about Lidia Thorpe [here](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/21/lidia-thorpe-who-is-the-mp-who-accused-king-charles-of-genocide-in-fiery-confrontation-in-australian-parliament-ntwnfb).

As an advocate for a treaty between the government and Indigenous peoples, she emphasized that sovereignty must be tied to the land. This incident highlights ongoing disparities faced by Indigenous Australians, including poorer [health](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-health/social-determinants-and-indigenous-health) and education outcomes. The recent rejection of a [referendum](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-67110193) for greater rights underscores the challenges ahead, emphasizing the need for meaningful dialogue and action to address these issues.

### Michigan Students Divided

Many progressive students in Michigan feel divided about whether to [cast their ballots](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/21/uncommitted-movement-michigan-college-voters-00184281) for Kamala Harris. They face pressure to decide between supporting Harris, who has gained some enthusiasm among younger voters, risking their votes on third-party candidates, or abstaining altogether. Many have reluctance to support Kamala Harris due to her perceived alignment with Israel’s actions and the ongoing situation with Gaza.

Many students are caught between their principles and fearing a potential Trump victory, particularly after a notable [uncommitted movement](https://www.uncommittedmovement.com/) during the Democratic primary. During this primary, many college voters chose not to support Biden. Some students will proceed with Kamala Harris anyway, while others say they will pick at the voting booth. Michigan is a possible state that could decide the 2024 election; it usually leans left. Although it has the largest Arab community in the country, many members feel increasingly [alienated](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-michigan-6b034753290276bfa96d7caf8f7639bf) by the Biden-Harris Administration toward Gaza.
