### World's Oceans Near Critical Acidification Levels

![World's Oceans Near Critical Acidification Levels](/images/world-s-oceans-are-becoming-too-acidic-MwOT.webp)

A new report reveals that the world’s oceans are approaching critical levels of [acidification](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/understanding-ocean-acidification) due to the continuous absorption of carbon dioxide from human activities. Acidification disrupts the ability of marine species such as oysters, clams, and corals to form shells and skeletons, which could trigger a collapse in marine ecosystems. Coral reefs, which protect coastlines and support fisheries, are particularly vulnerable, and their destruction could lead to significant economic and environmental consequences.

The acidification of the oceans is linked to broader climate change impacts, including rising sea levels and the loss of biodiversity. Scientists have warned that if global carbon emissions aren’t reduced drastically, the damage to marine life could become irreversible within a few decades.

### Hurricane Helene Could Become Catastrophic

Meteorologists warn that [Hurricane Helene](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/hurricane-helene-live-updates-rcna172799), currently a Category 2 storm, could intensify to [Category 4](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php) as it tracks through the Atlantic toward populated coastal regions. If it strengthens as expected, Helene could bring extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and dangerous storm surges, potentially causing widespread destruction. The [National Hurricane Center](https://x.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1839268697988542901) has urged residents in its projected path to prepare for evacuations and stay alert for updates.

Hurricane Helene is part of a larger trend of increasingly severe storms driven by climate change. Warmer ocean temperatures, caused by rising global temperatures, provide the fuel for these storms to grow stronger and more destructive. Experts are concerned that as climate change accelerates, hurricane seasons will become more dangerous, with more frequent and intense storms posing greater threats to coastal communities worldwide.

### Zelenskyy Visits White House Amid Partisan Divide

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s [visit to the White House](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/26/zelenskyy-visiting-white-house-partisan-divide-grows-over-ukraine-war.html) comes at a critical time as U.S. political divisions over support for Ukraine deepen. Since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the U.S. has provided significant military and financial aid to Ukraine. However, recent polls indicate that a growing number of Republicans are questioning the extent of U.S. involvement, citing concerns about the financial costs and the lack of a clear endgame.

During his visit, Zelenskyy met with President Joe Biden and addressed members of Congress, stressing Ukraine’s ongoing need for advanced weaponry to counter Russia’s advances. Zelenskyy also sought assurances that U.S. aid would continue despite the shifting political landscape. 

### US and France Draft Temporary Ceasefire Plan for Middle East

The U.S. and France jointly called on Wednesday for an immediate 21-day ceasefire to allow negotiations in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. [The conflict](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-25-2024-62cb173728d341c845bff9859addc7a5), which has claimed over 600 lives in Lebanon in recent days, has raised international alarm. The proposed ceasefire aims to create a humanitarian corridor, allowing aid to reach affected areas and providing an opportunity for diplomatic talks.

Both nations are concerned that the conflict could destabilize the broader region, with potential ripple effects on global security and oil markets. However, securing a ceasefire remains a challenge, as both Israel and Hezbollah continue to hold firm in their positions. 

### Japan Acquits Longest-Serving Death Row Inmate

![Japan Acquits Longest-Serving Death Row Inmate](/images/japan-acquits-longest-serving-death-row-inmate-56-years-after-murder-conviction-IyMT.webp)

In a landmark decision, Japan’s longest-serving death row inmate, Iwao Hakamada, was acquitted after spending 48 in prison for a murder he consistently denied committing. Hakamada, now 87, was convicted of killing a family of four in 1966, but new DNA evidence revealed that the bloodstains used to convict him did not match his. This breakthrough came after decades of legal battles and international pressure from human rights organizations.

Hakamada’s case has highlighted concerns about Japan’s reliance on confessions in criminal cases, often extracted under duress. [Amnesty International](https://x.com/amnesty/status/1839254193976013059) and other groups have long criticized Japan’s death penalty system, particularly for its treatment of death row inmates. The acquittal has reignited debate over the use of capital punishment in Japan, which remains one of the few developed [nations to still implement the death penalty.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45835584)
