### Uber fined 290 million for sending EU data to the US 

The Netherlands is fining Uber 290 million euros (around 324 USD) for transferring the personal data of European drivers to US servers. According to the Dutch data protection authority, this [violates EU rules](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy76v561g48o). The EU has a lot of regulations when it comes to data sharing.  Cross-border data is allowed between the EU and the US, but only within certain limits. Uber says the fine is unjust, and it will appeal the fine. The EU doesn’t play around with big tech firms and will not hesitate to issue fines for this. This is not the first time something similar has happened. Ireland fined TikTok for violating children’s privacy.

He was supposed to return to the US the day he crossed into North Korea, but he joined a tour of the demilitarized zone. He bolted across the border and was put in a van that drove off.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a [global SOS](https://www.dw.com/en/un-chief-guterres-warns-of-fast-rising-pacific-ocean/a-70055845).

Here is bad news for European travelers who want to carry wine or their nice shampoo in their hand luggage. All European Union airports must return to the [100 ml liquid limit](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/23/100ml-limit-on-liquids-to-return-to-all-eu-airports-from-september) for hand luggage this week. Many bigger airports have the latest generation of quality scanners and have loosened the restrictions on liquids in the last couple of years. However, Brussels has said this limit needs to be temporarily reinstated.  While this is a hassle for the passengers who prefer hand luggage, it does erase the confusion about which airports have the 100-liter limit and which do not. It has been a guessing game before.

### Germany to give Africa 100,000 Mpox vaccines

Germany has announced it will give 100,000 doses of Mpox vaccines to the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African nations most affected by the new and deadlier strain of Mpox. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit says the German government is happy to work alongside the affected countries to foster vaccine production. The WHO has declared Mpox a [global emergency](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/countries-donate-mpox-vaccines-combat-outbreak-africa-2024-08-28/). The disease is mainly contained in a handful of East African countries. France has said it will give 100,000 doses, and the US plans to give 50,000. 

### Police standoff with Filipino cult

The Philippine police are presently engaged in a days-long [stand-off](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/27/asia/philippines-apollo-quiboloy-davao-police-intl-hnk/index.html) with followers of Quiboloy Davao’s religious cult named the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. 2,000 officers are surrounding the church compound. 18 arrests have been made, but Quiboloy is believed to be still hiding in the compound. Quiboloy is wanted by both the FBI and the local police on various sex abuse and human trafficking charges. He has been on the run for several years. He was the spiritual advisor to the controversial former president Rodrigo Dutete.  Many are comparing this to the infamous Waco standoff in 1995. Hopefully, the results won’t be close to the same level.
