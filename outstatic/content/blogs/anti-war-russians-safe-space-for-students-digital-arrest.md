### Russians against war

![Russian opposition figures in Berlin call for an end to the Ukraine war](/images/russians-in-berlin-hold-protest-march--1--I3Mj.webp)

In Berlin, prominent Russian opposition figures—Yulia Navalnaya, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and Ilya Yashin—led a [demonstration](https://www.dw.com/en/russian-opposition-in-exile-holds-berlin-protest-march/a-70804993) calling for an end to the war in Ukraine and the removal of President Vladimir Putin. Hundreds gathered at Potsdamer Platz, marching to the Russian Embassy with banners saying “No Putin. No War” and “Victory for Ukraine.” [Navalnaya](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9g4ln2d8eo), whose husband Alexei Navalny died in prison, is committed to continuing his opposition work. 

The situation with the Ukraine war has been a challenging subject for Russians abroad. While many are vocal about it, some might not share the same distaste for Putin. For example, tensions flared in Vienna on May 9th, as pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian groups [clashed](https://www.newsweek.com/russians-ukrainians-face-off-vienna-over-9th-may-victory-day-1799284) during “Victory Day” celebrations. Some of the Russian supporters said this was only about the Nazi defeat in 1945, while some said they were against all wars and it is partly NATOS fault. This reflects conflicting narratives about history and the ongoing war in Ukraine.

### Secret debates

![Academic pubs in China offer a rare space for open intellectual discussion](/images/young-chinese-flock-to--academic-pubs--as-space-for-free-expression-shrinks--1--I0Nj.webp)

In recent months, “academic pubs” have [emerged](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/15/china/china-academic-pubs-intl-hnk/index.html) in major Chinese cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. These meeting points offer a rare platform for intellectual discussion in an increasingly censored society. These informal gatherings are usually held in bars, where scholars and young urbanites can discuss various topics, including politically sensitive issues like feminism and lighter subjects like social anxiety. They are inspired by Western initiatives like “[Cafe Scientifique](http://cafescientifique.org/),” the sessions have gained popularity, especially after pandemic lockdowns, providing an alternative space for debate outside the confines of Chinese university campuses.

The relaxed setting encourages open conversation, where participants can express diverse opinions without the strict authority typically present in classrooms. However, there are concerns that these gatherings could eventually face restrictions. China’s growing [censorship](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/3.htm) and crackdowns on public expression threaten their future. Despite this, academic pub organizers remain optimistic as long as events remain informal and decentralized.

### Digital arrest

Many victims have fallen for [sophisticated scams](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrdyxk4k4ro), leading to the loss of large amounts of money. Scammers impersonating law enforcement convinced them they were under federal investigation, fabricating a “digital arrest” that forced them to take leave from work and submit to constant phone surveillance. Prime Minister [Modi](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze3302zxr9o) has publicly warned citizens not to share personal information over the phone, emphasizing that “digital arrest” is a hoax.

This scam has cost victims millions of rupees across India, with scammers exploiting targeted information from social media. Despite police efforts, stolen funds can’t always be recovered. Such scams are not unique to India; they also go on in the US. Many [scam calls](https://www.azd.uscourts.gov/news/scam-alert-do-not-pay-callers-who-threaten-arrest-you-unless-you-pay) are going around claiming to be part of the IRS or that someone is under investigation and must pay money to avoid arrest. Similarly to India, someone cannot call and demand money and personal information. It does not work that way.
