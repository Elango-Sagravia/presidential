So far, 12 migrants have died off the northern French coast on Tuesday while trying to cross the English Channel to England. The boat went into trouble and capsized about 5 kilometers off the coast. This is the [deadliest crossing](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240903-boat-carrying-migrants-capsizes-in-english-channel-killing-at-least-12) this year. Several of the deaths were from minors. There were many more injured from this. French emergency services were out in full force to provide medical assistance. 

25 migrants have died this year trying to cross the English Channel. It’s over twice the number from 2023. On Wednesday, French officials decided that there needs to be a joint EU and UK migration treaty to sort out the situation 

### Ex-Aid to New York governors charged with being a Chinese agent

Linda Sun, a former aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Andrew Cuomo, is being charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government. The [official charges](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/linda-sun-former-hochul-staff-arrest/index.htm) against her are failure to register as a foreign agent, visa fraud, alien smuggling, and money laundering conspiracy. Her husband, Chris Hu, is also facing charges of money laundering. The couple plead not guilty to the charges. 

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs claims to be unaware of this. Prosecutors claim she blocked Taiwanese government representatives from access to the officials, obtained official New York State proclamations for Chinese government representatives, and influenced the messaging of high-level state officials regarding issues of importance to China. She also accepted many lavish gifts for her work.

### Pope appeals against extremism in Indonesia

The first stop on the Pope’s trip to Asia was Jakarta, [Indonesia](https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-pope-francis-meets-joko-widodo-rebuts-extremism/a-70126944), to meet with President Joesph Widodo. Although Indonesia’s Catholics make up only 3% of the country, given its largest size, there are still 8 million Catholics. Like the rest of Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the countries where the religion is growing.

 Both leaders spoke about dealing with religious extremism and stressed the importance of interfaith dialogue.  They also met with leaders of other faiths. Indonesia is predominantly Muslim, and while most of them are not very religious, there are some regions, such as Aceh, where extremism has become a big problem.

On Labor Day, five people were shot at New York’s West [Indian Day parade](https://apnews.com/article/new-york-west-indian-caribbean-parade-shooting-0161656d6254157e3654f59df8123346). One of them died from injuries sustained from gunshots.  The other four are in the hospital. Police are still looking for the shooter. They believe one person did this with some problem with West Indians as a group; it wasn’t random. 

New York has a sizable West Indian and Caribbean community. The West Indian Day parade is one of the most popular events in late summer. It’s popular with local politicians (particularly ones of this background) and is held in Brooklyn every Labor Day. 

### Greta was arrested at a Pro Palestine rally in Denmark

Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was [arrested](https://www.politico.eu/article/greta-thunberg-arrested-pro-palestinian-campus-protest-university-copenhagen-police/) during a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Copenhagen on Wednesday. Before being arrested, she shared a video of herself at the Univesity of Copenhagen’s Palestinian Protest. Student protests have been picking up on campuses all over the world. Some of them have been intervened by the police.

Before getting involved in Pro-Palestinian activism, Greta was mainly focused on climate change. This has left a mixed response with the crowd she follows. Many of them believe there is a strong correlation between the problems in Palestine and climate change. Others feel like she ditched the whole issue of climate change for a newer and more trendy cause. 

### Argentine court rules that football can’t be privatized

A [court in Buenos Aires](https://www.dw.com/en/argentina-court-blocks-milei-move-to-privatize-football/a-70122667) has ruled against Argentine President Javier Milei in trying to open football ( or Soccer for American readers)  to private investment. Milei came to become president in December; his primary mission is to tackle Argentina's economic crisis by making massive cuts to public spending and privatizing many things from the public sector, including football. 

While Argentina is the reigning world champion in football, many are not fans of its status. Football in Argentina is labeled a nonprofit civil association. While it puts off investors, it gives it a socio-cultural status in Argentina, so it has a central role in local communities.

### Maduro moves Christmas to October

Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro recently decreed that [Christmas festivities](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-christmas) in Venezuela will be moved to October 1st. He also promised all Venezuelans a Christmas of peace, happiness, and security. Well, maybe not all; it's for the Venezuelans on his “nice list” this year. A lot of them are on the “naughty list.” Maduro is currently under fire from many Venezuelans around the world, and many officials from all over the world aren’t even acknowledging the results of July’s election.

 Strangely, this isn’t even the first time he has done this since becoming president in 2013. He has done this several times. Many say it is to try to hide the economic setbacks in his presidency, which have been at all-time lows.
