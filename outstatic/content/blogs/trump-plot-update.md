### Update on Trump Assassination Attempt Suspect

![Trump Assassination Attempt: Who Is Suspect Ryan Routh?](/images/trump-assassination-attempt---who-is-suspect-ryan-routh--QwMj.webp)

More details have emerged about [Ryan Routh](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3611zjjnd2o), the man arrested for the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Routh, who once supported Trump, later turned against him and called him a "buffoon" in his self-published book. On social media, Routh portrayed himself as a globe-trotting freedom fighter, allegedly attempting to recruit people to fight in Ukraine, though he never participated in combat himself.

He had switched his political stance in 2020, donating to Democratic candidates. Following his arrest, Routh faces two gun charges. Trump, who spoke with Biden briefly about the incident, later blamed Biden and Harris for fostering a hostile political environment.

### Japan’s Elderly Population Reaches Record High

Japan’s elderly population now comprises 36.25 million people over 65 or older, accounting for almost 30% of the Japanese population. Japan’s population also decreased by half a million in the last year. The situation is expected to worsen, and the aging population might reach nearly 35% by 2040.

Japan has one of the [world's longest life expectancies](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20170807-living-in-places-where-people-live-the-longest), thanks to a healthy lifestyle and economic prosperity. However, this is a double-edged sword. The country faces rising healthcare and welfare costs, coupled with a shrinking workforce. Japan's strict immigration laws may need to be relaxed in the coming years to address these demographic shifts and labor shortages.

### Germany Implements Border Checks Amid Migration Concerns

Germany began [border checks](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-begins-expanded-border-controls-to-control-migration/a-70218944) with nine neighboring countries on Monday in an effort to control irregular migration. Previously, only selective checks were conducted, but now all travelers entering Germany by car, bus, or train will be subject to inspection.

The move has already caused delays and has drawn criticism from neighboring countries like Poland, which warned the checks could undermine the Schengen system of free movement. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Austria, are considering similar measures. Schengen members are permitted to implement [border controls in emergencies](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area/temporary-reintroduction-border-control_en), and Germany’s decision could set a precedent for other nations.

### Shanghai Braces for Typhoon Bebinca

Shanghai went into lockdown on Monday due to [Typhoon Bebinca](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/typhoon-bebinca-shanghai-china-strongest-storm-1949-flights-cancelled-4610486), the strongest storm to hit the city in seven decades. While only a category one typhoon, Bebinca brought heavy rainfall, downing thousands of trees and disrupting over 1,000 flights.

The storm's timing has been particularly disruptive, coinciding with China’s three-day[ Mid-Autumn Festival](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/3278375/what-mid-autumn-festival-and-why-do-chinese-families-celebrate-it) holiday. Although Shanghai typically avoids direct hits from typhoons, this year has seen an unusually active typhoon season across Asia, further intensifying the impact on daily life.

Thousands gathered across France last weekend in solidarity with [Gisele Pelicot](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/gisele-pelicot-men-accused-rape-1.7324328), a survivor of long-term abuse by her husband, who is currently on trial. He is accused of drugging her and facilitating assaults by strangers, a crime that went on for nearly a decade. Pelicot has become a symbol of strength and resilience for survivors of sexual violence, choosing to make the trial public to raise awareness about such crimes.

While her husband was scheduled to testify, health issues led to his [absence](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240911-frenchman-in-mass-rape-trial-again-excused-from-testifying-due-to-ill-health). Fifty other individuals accused of involvement are also standing trial. The case has sparked nationwide outrage and renewed calls for stronger protections for survivors of abuse.

### Growing Concerns for Haitian Communities in the US

Haitian communities in the US, particularly in Springfield, Ohio, are facing increased threats following [claims](https://apnews.com/article/haitian-immigrants-vance-trump-ohio-6e4a47c52b23ae2c802d216369512ca5) made by former President Trump during a recent debate. Trump’s comments, alongside remarks from Vice President JD Vance, have contributed to [rising tensions](https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-americans-fear-for-their-safety-after-trump-repeats-false-claims-about-immigrants/7781117.html).

Springfield saw a significant influx of Haitian migrants over the past decade, helping the local economy recover. However, recent political rhetoric has led to threats against Haitian families, with some keeping their children home from school. Despite this, local communities have rallied to support Haitian-run businesses and families.
