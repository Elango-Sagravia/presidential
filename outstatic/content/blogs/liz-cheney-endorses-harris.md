### Republican Liz Cheney Endorses Kamala Harris

Republican former congresswoman Liz Cheney has said she will vote for Kamala Harris in the US elections in November. She made this [announcement](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/liz-cheney-voting-kamala-harris/index.html) in North Carolina, a key battleground state. She said that even though she is a conservative, she thinks Donald Trump poses a danger. She has been notable in the past for being one of the Republicans who voted against Trump and opposed some of his measures.

This endorsement is an interesting one. Kamala Harris faces challenges in getting the support of moderates who lean right tbut don’t like Trump. But she also has issues with the progressive vote, which opposes her on issues such as Israel-Gaza.

A former Philippine ex-mayor who was on the run for some weeks was recently arrested in Indonesia. The story gets even more complicated. Philippine authorities have been pursuing Alice Guo in several countries after an investigation into her alleged criminal activities; some of them are allegations of her [spying for China](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mnyrm8739o).

China hasn’t commented yet on her arrest. She was in trouble for running a scam or organized crime business disguised as an online casino. Her clients were from mainland China, where gambling is illegal. These accusations come at a peak time, as China and the Philippines are presently involved in disputes with the South China Sea.

### The Famous Budapest District Could Get Rid of Airbnb

A district in Budapest is voting on whether to ban Airbnb. This is the 6th district which is one of the trendy ones where others visit. About 7% of the district’s housing is made up of Airbnb. Many districts could consider the same as housing is becoming an issue in Budapest.

This would not be the first case of a city cracking down on Airbnb. Barcelona heavily reduced the number of Airbnbs and is even considering eliminating them. Other places in Europe and the US (particularly Hawaii and New York) have this topic in discussion. [Overtourism](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/tourism-why-it-went-wrong/index.html) has been a major problem in the last couple of summers since travel has bounced back from Covid-19. Many places find it hard to find the right balance between being tourist-friendly destinations and being desirable for locals.

Typhoons have been a big theme in Asia this year. Southern China and Hong Kong are bracing themselves for super typhoon Yagi. The storm hit the Philippines this week and killed 13 people. The storm is likely to hit China’s tropical Hainan province. It could be the strongest typhoon to hit China in many years.

Scientists say that the increasing number of typhoons in Asia is a result of warmer waters and climate change. A major Typhoon hit Japan just last week. Japan isn’t the area where typhoons happen as much. It is more about the tropical waters of the South Pacific. Even in mainland China, one of this size is relatively rare.

### Dutch “Serial Sperm Donor” Sues Netflix

Jonathan Meijer, the guy from the [Netflix](https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-serial-sperm-donor-sues-sensationalist-netflix/a-70134557) show "The Man With 1,000 Kids," is suing the company for its portrayal of him fathering hundreds (maybe thousands) of children as a sperm donor. He says the show has slandered him and the families he helped create. He believes the tally that Netflix made is also incorrect. Netflix estimated he could have made up to 1,000-3000 kids worldwide.

He was ordered to stop doing this in the Netherlands last year. Dutch Sperm banks allow a 25-kid maximum. Many of the families he arranged to donate sperm for, he made the arrangements on the internet. He refused to cooperate with Netflix as he felt it was a shady company.

### New Māori Queen in New Zealand

New Zealand’s Māori chiefs have chosen Nga Wai, the 27-year-old daughter of the late King Tuheita, as the [new Māori queen](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/9/5/maori-in-new-zealand-anoint-a-new-queen). Although the Māori monarchy holds no legal power, it remains an important cultural symbol of unity for the Māori people, representing their heritage and history.

The Māori King movement, founded in 1858 to unite New Zealand’s tribes against British colonization, continues to play a ceremonial role. Today, the Māori people make up 17% of New Zealand's population and continue to face disparities in health, education, and living standards compared to other New Zealanders.
