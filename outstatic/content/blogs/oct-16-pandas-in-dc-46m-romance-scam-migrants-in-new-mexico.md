### Pandas Return to D.C.

![Two giant pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, arrived at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C](/images/pandas-arrive-washington-dc-Y3NT.webp)

Two giant pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, arrived at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., marking a [much-anticipated return](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pandas-from-china-returning-national-zoo/) after the previous pair left for China last year. The pandas, both three years old, made the journey from Chengdu, China, with a brief stop in Alaska before arriving in Washington. They will undergo a 30-day quarantine before making their public debut in January 2025. Bao Li has a U.S. connection—his mother was born at the National Zoo.

Pandas remain a rare sight, with only a [handful of zoos worldwide](https://www.pandasinternational.org/pandas-around-the-globe/) having the privilege to host them under contracts with China. The National Zoo is among these select few, while the only pandas outside such agreements are in Mexico City and Taipei.

### $46M Romance Scam Busted

In Hong Kong, a significant case of a [deepfake romance scam](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/15/asia/hong-kong-deepfake-romance-scam-intl-hnk/index.html) has come to light, with reports indicating that victims have been defrauded nearly $46 million. The authorities stepped up and raided the operations, arresting 27 suspects, including digital media graduates. 

These perpetrators are known to leverage advanced technology to fabricate false identities, drawing individuals into elaborate emotional relationships [(example)](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2023/12/asia/chinese-scam-operations-american-victims-intl-hnk-dst/). Scammers often employ images of attractive individuals to manipulate and deceive victims, ultimately convincing them to transfer funds.

In a related case earlier this year, a British multinational design and engineering company in Hong Kong [lost $25 million](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html) to fraudsters who used deepfake technology to pose as the company’s chief financial officer. 

### Migrants in New Mexico

![Migrants in New Mexico](/images/migrant-deaths-increase-by-a-10-fold-in-new-mexico-kzMj.webp)

The number of [migrant deaths in New Mexico](https://www.newsweek.com/migrant-deaths-new-mexico-border-rise-ten-fold-1969118) has spiked to 108 bodies found in the first eight months of 2024 compared to just 9 in 2020. This increase is attributed to smugglers leading vulnerable migrants into dangerous and remote terrains, including deserts and mountains west of El Paso, Texas, where conditions are often deadly. Women, especially those aged 20-29, make up nearly half of the fatalities.

Authorities are amping up efforts to address this growing humanitarian crisis. New Mexico recently arrested 16 individuals involved in human [smuggling networks](https://nmpoliticalreport.com/featured/multi-agency-border-operation-apprehends-16-rescues-91/) and rescued 91 trafficked migrants.  The rise in migrant deaths comes amid broader immigration debates in the U.S., especially for the 2024 presidential election. Despite a decline in overall migration after the Biden administration’s stricter asylum rules, the number of deaths in New Mexico now rivals those in Arizona’s Sonoran Desert, a historically dangerous region for migrants.

### Filipinas Arrested for Surrogacy

Thirteen pregnant women from the Philippines have been [accused of acting as surrogate](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/13/asia/philippine-women-arrested-cambodia-surrogacy-intl-hnk/index.html) mothers in Cambodia after being recruited online. Following a police raid in Kandal province, they were charged under laws [banning commercial surrogacy](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/article/dodging-a-crackdown-in-cambodia-this-australian-couple-smuggled-the-surrogate-carrying-their-twins/xcegk0hfs). The law was put in place to protect women from being victims of human trafficking. While the women are currently in hospital care, they face potential prison sentences of two to five years after giving birth. 

Authorities view them as offenders rather than victims and say they knew the implications before agreeing. The Philippine Embassy confirmed their involvement and ensured proper procedures were followed during the investigation.
