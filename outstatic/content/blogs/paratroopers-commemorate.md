![Paratroopers from 13 NATO countries](/images/paratroopers-dropped-near-arnhem-in-the-netherlands--commemorating-80-years-since-one-of-the-most-renowned-world-war-i-operations.-A5OT.webp)

Hundreds of paratroopers from 13 NATO countries, including the Dutch Air Mobile Brigade, gathered at Ginkel Heath in the Netherlands to commemorate the 80th anniversary of [Operation Market Garden](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-story-of-operation-market-garden-in-photos). This World War II mission aimed to liberate parts of the Netherlands by dropping 35,000 paratroopers behind enemy lines. Despite its daring nature, the operation failed when German forces resisted at Arnhem. 

Among the attendees was 99-year-old veteran Geoff Roberts, who was captured during the battle. Reflecting on the mission, Roberts noted the hardships faced [(watch video)](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cqlvd41pnk7o). Though the operation failed, it contributed to future NATO cooperation. Around 60,000 spectators attended the event, honoring the sacrifices made during the operation.

### Whooping Cough Cases Spike

According to the CDC, whooping cough cases in the U.S. have surged, quadrupling from 3,475 last year to [14,569 this year](https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/static/2024/37/2024-37-table990.html). Experts link this increase to declining vaccination rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many children missed routine check-ups. The whooping cough vaccines provide crucial protection, but vaccination levels haven't fully recovered. 

Early symptoms of whooping cough resemble a common cold, making it hard to diagnose until severe coughing fits develop. Infants who can't be vaccinated until they are two months old are the most vulnerable. To protect newborns, the [CDC advises](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/tdap-vaccination-for-pregnant-people.html) pregnant women to get vaccinated in their last trimester, ensuring early protection for vulnerable babies.
