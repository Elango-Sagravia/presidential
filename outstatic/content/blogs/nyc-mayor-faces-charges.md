Swiss authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the use of Sarco suicide pods after determining that they do not meet safety regulations. The 3D-printed pods, created by the organization ["The Last Resort,"](https://www.thelastresort.ch/) are designed for euthanasia and have drawn international attention. A [recent case ](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/24/europe/switzerland-arrests-sarco-suicide-capsule-intl-hnk/index.html)involved a 64-year-old American woman who used the device in a forest near Merishausen before authorities seized the pod and took her body for autopsy.

Several individuals connected to "The Last Resort" were arrested, though most have been released pending further investigation. Switzerland, which has some of the most liberal euthanasia laws in the world, requires that methods comply with stringent safety standards, raising questions about the future use of such devices.

Former President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York, emphasizing his belief that he could broker a [peace deal](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/politics/trump-zelensky-meeting/index.html) between Ukraine and Russia.

The meeting came as Zelensky sought to secure continued U.S. support while Trump was critical of the ongoing U.S. aid to Ukraine.

### Belgian Prime Minister Pressures Pope

During Pope Francis' visit to Belgium, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called on the Catholic Church to take more decisive action in addressing clerical sexual abuse scandals. De Croo demanded that the Church prioritize victims' interests, acknowledge past misdeeds, and improve transparency. King Philippe also joined the call for greater accountability from the Church.

Pope Francis expressed shame and humility over the Church's history of sexual abuse, describing it as a "scourge" and reiterating the Church’s commitment to addressing the issue. He [apologized](https://www.euronews.com/video/2024/09/27/belgian-pm-blasts-pope-francis-for-catholic-churchs-sex-abuse-cover-up-legacy) on behalf of the Church and pledged to work toward justice for the victims, but the pressure for more concrete action continues to grow.
