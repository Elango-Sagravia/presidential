**Rabbi murdered in UAE**

Israel has [confirmed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy4j5j7503o) the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who had been missing in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since Thursday. Kogan, an envoy of the [Chabad Lubavitch organization](https://www.lubavitch.com/emissary-murdered-in-cold-blood/), was found dead after his car was discovered abandoned an hour’s drive from his home. Israeli authorities, including the Mossad, are working alongside UAE officials to investigate the crime. The UAE has arrested three individuals in connection with the murder.

Israel’s Prime Minister condemned the killing as a “criminal antisemitic terrorist incident,” and President Isaac Herzog called it “a vile, antisemitic attack.” The Israeli government has [issued a warning](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-reiterates-warning-against-nonessential-travel-to-uae-after-death-of-rabbi/) for citizens traveling to the UAE due to the potential risks, citing ongoing terrorist activity.

**RFK and fluoride water**

President-elect Donald Trump has [nominated](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/14/politics/robert-f-kennedy-donald-trump-hhs/index.html) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his Health and Human Services secretary, focusing on health care in his second term. Kennedy is known for his controversial views on public health, particularly his campaign against [water fluoridation](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/23/health/fluoride-drinking-water-dg/index.html) due to concerns over various health issues, including arthritis and neurodevelopmental disorders. While fluoride is added to water to prevent tooth decay, its health effects are debated. 

[The World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wash-documents/wash-chemicals/fluoride-background-document.pdf) warns that excessive fluoride can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis. Despite the risks, many studies suggest fluoridation has reduced cavities, particularly in children. Recent research has also questioned its potential impact on children's IQ, although the studies have been questionable. In the U.S., fluoridation decisions are made locally, and while most Americans have [access to fluoridated water](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/php/statistics/index.html), the practice remains controversial.

**Trump’s government overhaul**

The second Trump administration seeks to [dismantle government structures,](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/24/trump-vow-to-blowtorch-disrupt-government-finds-appeal-with-americans/76407415007/) appealing to supporters frustrated by bureaucracy. His Cabinet choices aim to reduce government size and address grievances over military involvement and a perceived “deep state.” Polling shows declining public trust in U.S. institutions, which fuels the populist movements Trump supports with his "America First" policies focused on protectionism, limiting immigration, and cutting spending. Critics, like Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel, warn that this could hurt vulnerable populations reliant on programs like SNAP and Medicare, increasing inequalities favoring the wealthy. Trump also plans to eliminate the [Department of Education](https://fortune.com/2024/11/20/trump-dismantle-education-department-what-that-would-mean/).

The administration will likely pursue its agenda through executive orders and budget reconciliation, though significant changes may face opposition in the Senate and federal courts. The next few years are anticipated to be politically contentious, focusing on government spending, taxation, and the state's role. Ultimately, Trump’s success will hinge on balancing his vision with the needs of key voter segments.
