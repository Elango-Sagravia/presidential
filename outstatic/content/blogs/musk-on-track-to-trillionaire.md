### Musk on Track to Trillionaire Status

![Elon Musk Is on Track to Become a Trillionaire](/images/elon-musk-is-on-track-to-become-a-trillionaire-c4MT.webp)

The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, [might be a trillionaire](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/09/17/business/elon-musk-richest-person-trillionaire) within a few years. Musk’s net worth is currently around a quarter of a billion. His businesses with X, Tesla, and Space X are seeing astronomical returns. He could hit the trillionaire mark as soon as 2027. While Elon Musk is a heavily controversial figure, his financial success is empirical.

This projection follows the recent success of SpaceX, which launched its first civilian mission, marking a significant milestone in private space exploration. However, Musk's billionaire status will largely depend on the future performance of Tesla, his biggest asset. He owns nearly 13% of the company, a stake worth about $93 billion at current prices.

### Secret Service Under Scrutiny

One of the most significant issues revealed by Sunday’s assassination attempt on President Trump, his second barely over two months, is the Secret Service's overall [performance](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2yyr7283vo). Phone records indicate that the suspect had been at Trump’s golf course for 12 hours. Many wonder why the Secret Service didn’t secure parameters in time.

Despite being at the peak of election campaigning, Biden and Trump set aside some time for a cordial phone [call](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4882959-joe-biden-donald-trump-potential-assassination-attempt/). The primary subject addressed in the phone call was the issue with the Secret Service. This is a bipartisan issue, as every sitting and former President has them for life.

### Man Accused of Trying to Destroy Jewish Center Fights Extradition

A 20-year-old Pakistani man in Canada who has been accused of trying to destroy a Jewish center in New York says he is [appealing](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-09-16/man-accused-of-plot-to-attack-new-york-jewish-center-will-contest-extradition-lawyer-says#:~:text=Muhammad%20Shahzeb%20Khan%2C%2020%2C%20was,States%20wants%20to%20extradite%20him.) his extradition to stand trial in the US. He is being [charged](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-terror-plot-arrest-new-york-c982020997f177894404dae26b442e16) with attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. His lawyers are asking for more proof of reason to extradite him, citing his young age.

Canada has an extradition treaty with the U.S. While plenty of countries with extradition treaties with the US do not always extradite those wanted for arrest and trial, close allies infrequently do this except in cases where execution is on the table. This is not the case, as the penalty he is facing is 20 years.

### TikTok Makes Its Case

![TikTok’s legal battle against a U.S. ban](/images/tik-tok-argued-against-its-ban-UzMz.webp)

TikTok [appealed](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/16/g-s1-23194/tiktok-us-ban-appeals-court) in court on Tuesday against its ban in the US. The company’s main plea is that free expression is more important than national security and that banning it can set a bad precedent.TikTok has been the most controversial social media platform in the United States and has been scrutinized most.

Critics argue that the app’s foreign ownership is the main issue, while others believe its massive popularity, particularly among young users, is a factor. With 170 million profiles in the U.S. alone, TikTok faces global challenges, as other [countries](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/these-countries-have-already-banned-tiktok) have already enacted restrictions or bans on the app.

### Burning Tank in Red Sea Saved

The burning oil tanker MV Sounion, which Yemen’s Houthis attacked, has been [safely relocated](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r8gn50qx0o) in the Red Sea without any oil spilling. The Greek-owned vessel was carrying nearly a million barrels of crude oil when it was struck by missiles on August 21, forcing the crew to abandon the ship. Fortunately, a major ecological disaster has been averted, as a spill in the Red Sea could have had devastating environmental and economic consequences.

[Houthis](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67614911) have attacked and destroyed 30 ships in the Red Sea, including shipping containers and oil tankers. While they haven’t targeted U.S. vessels, they have hit ships from U.S. allies, including Britain and Greece. The recent conflict between Israel and Gaza has intensified these attacks.
