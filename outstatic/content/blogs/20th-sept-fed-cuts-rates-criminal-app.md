### Federal Reserve Lowers US Interest Rate

![](/images/federal-reserve-lowers-us-interest-rates-weeks-before-us-elections-U3Nj.jpg)

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240918a.htm) a 0.50 percentage point cut in its benchmark interest rate, just six weeks before the upcoming elections, marking the first reduction since 2020. The rate cut brings the federal funds rate down to a range of 4.75% to 5%, a drop from the previous 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest in 23 years.

The decision comes as inflation, though easing, continues to impact household expenses, with the Fed seeking to balance economic growth with price stability. While some analysts see the cut as a boost to the economy ahead of the elections, the Federal Reserve maintains that its actions are strictly tied to economic indicators and not political considerations.

### Global Police Sting Dismantles Ghost App

A joint police effort [took down](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240918-global-police-sting-targets-users-of-organised-crime-app) the Ghost app, previously marketed to criminals as “unhackable.” The app worked similarly to WhatsApp, but the big catch was that it could be accessed by a particular modified smartphone, which cost about $1,590. The type of criminal activity that took place on this app ranged from drug trafficking to homicide. The authorities had closely monitored the app since 2022 before finding the mastermind.

It took police from nine different countries to make this happen. French police first tracked down the creator’s location in Australia and notified the local police to join forces in catching him. Police apprehended the alleged creator, a 32-year-old Australian man who had the reputation of being a computer geek.

### Iran Denies Election Interference Allegations

US intelligence authorities believe that Iranian hackers sent stolen information from Donald Trump's electoral campaign to people linked to the Biden campaign in June and July when Biden was still the nominee. A spokesperson for the Iranian mission to the UN has [denied](https://iranwire.com/en/news/134088-iran-denies-interference-in-us-elections-at-un/) any part on Iran’s behalf, as it hasn’t a motive of foreign interference.

Many might wonder why Iran would have a motive, as the Iranian government didn’t have an optimal relationship with the Biden administration. However, the Trump administration brought Washington-Tehran relations to a historic low, with the major milestones being the cancellation of the Iran deal and the imposition of a country ban for Iranians.

### Vietnamese Business Tycoon on Death Row Faces New Charges

![](/images/vietnamese-business-tycoon-on-death-row-has-a-trial-A2ND.jpg)

Vietnamese billionaire Truong My Lan, who is already on death row, has to sit through [another trial](https://www.dw.com/en/vietnam-tycoon-on-death-row-faces-new-trial/a-70263896). The trial is not to appeal her death sentence but to add on new charges, which include money laundering, obtaining property by fraud, and illegal cross-border money transfers.

In April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling 12.5 billion USD, which accounts for 3% of Vietnam’s GDP for 2022. Her death sentence was handed to make an example out of her, as the Vietnamese communist party has been on an exhaustive drive against [corruption](https://www.dw.com/en/vietnam-reels-from-historic-114-billion-corruption-scandal/a-67606137), which has been labeled “the blazing furnace campaign.” Vietnam is one of the few countries that uses the death penalty for financial crimes.

### UN Scrutinizes Russia for Power Grid Attacks

The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine believes that Russia has likely violated humanitarian law with its [strikes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/27/russia-ukraine-target-each-others-energy-sector) on Ukrainian power grids. Since the war began in 2022, Russia has struck quite a few Ukrainian power plants, causing Ukraine to lose the amount of power needed for the three Baltic States.

Russia claims that power plants are legitimate targets. However, the looming winter is the greater concern, when power outages could have even more severe consequences. The European Union plans to [allocate funds](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-send-160-million-euros-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine-2024-09-19/) from frozen Russian oligarch assets to support Ukraine's energy needs during winter.
