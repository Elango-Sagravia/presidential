### Missing Hawaiian woman

\
![Missing Hawaiian Woman: Search continues for Hannah Kobayashi, last seen in LA before disappearance and father's death.](/images/hawaii-U4Nz.webp)

The unresolved Hannah Kobayashi’s two-week disappearance, followed by the recent suicide of her father, Ryan Kobayashi, is a [heartbreaking tragedy](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/26/us/hannah-kobayashi-missing-woman-what-we-know/index.html). The family grieved Mr. Koyayashi’s death and said it was from a “broken heart.” Hannah was reported missing days after she failed to board her connecting flight to New York on November 8 and was last seen in Los Angeles, where she sent disturbing messages about identity theft and feeling unsafe. Despite a diligent search, Mr. Kobayashi, who was estranged from his daughter, took his own life after nearly two weeks of searching.

As they continue the search for Hannah, the case raises questions about her circumstances, including her distressing communications and who she was with during her last known sightings. The family is urging the community to support the ongoing search for Hannah and come forward with any information that could be helpful.

### 4B movement’s influence on America

![4B Movement's Influence: South Korean 4B movement gains traction in the U.S., challenging traditional gender roles.](/images/hawaii2-Q0ND.webp)

The 4B movement, originating from South Korea, has recently [gained attention](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/16/4b-movement-america-political-protest-00189314) in the U.S. as a response to the victory of Donald Trump. The rollback of reproductive rights and the cultural acceptance of sexual rhetoric are frustrating young women. This movement is gaining in both Korea and the U.S. because women are agitated by growing violence against women, and societal pressures are increasingly rejecting traditional gender roles. The movement’s core principles are no marriage, no dating, no childbirth, and no sex.

For many women, the 4B mindset offers a sense of empowerment and autonomy, especially amid political polarization and rising misogyny. However, its radical nature has sparked backlash and division, with some fearing that it could deepen [gender divides](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241030-gender-gap-how-the-us-election-is-becoming-a-battle-of-the-sexes) and lead to further alienation, which could be deconstructive.

### US and China swap prisoners

The recent prisoner swap between the US and China resulted in the [release of three US citizens](https://www.euronews.com/2024/11/28/china-releases-three-us-citizens-in-rare-prisoner-swap) held in China. In exchange, China received four individuals, including three Chinese nationals. The swap happened just ​​after Biden discussed the issue with Xi Jinping during the [APEC conference](https://www.euronews.com/2024/11/17/biden-and-xi-hold-talks-in-peru-but-no-mention-of-north-korean-troops-in-russia) in Peru.

The US detainees included Mark Swidan, who faced a death sentence on drug charges, and Kai Li and John Leung, imprisoned for espionage. American government designated all three as “wrongfully detained.” The lawmakers were happy about the release, especially of Kai Li, who had been detained since 2016. Despite ongoing trade, human rights, and security tensions, this rare agreement is a minor relief in tense [US-China relations](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cxw7qng7vx8t). The development precedes Trump’s anticipated presidency, which promises a more rigid stance on China.
