### Russian Strike in Poltava kills dozens

Ukraine's president Zelenskyy on Tuesday said that two Russian ballistic missiles had hit an educational institution and hospitals in central Ukraine. This is [one of the deadliest attacks](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-updates-poltava-missile-strike-kills-dozens/live-70116702) in Ukraine since the war started in 2022. The death toll from this is now at 41 people, and 180 have been injured. Twenty-five people were pulled out of the ruble. This comes at a bizarre time as President Putin was visiting ICC member Mongolia ( where they are legally supposed to arrest him)  when this happened. Strikes from Russia all over Ukraine have been picking up in the last week.

### Putin received a warm welcome in Mongolia

### Spain’s crackdown on holiday rentals turns out to be lucrative for luxury hotels

Luxury hotels have been one element of Spanish tourism that has done well with the [Spanish crackdowns](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spains-crackdown-holiday-rentals-bodes-well-luxury-hotels-2024-09-03/) on short-term holiday rentals. This summer, Spain has had a series of problems related to overtourism. There were several incidents where tourists were told to go home.  Many cities have banned or severely limited the number of short-term rentals. Many say this has caused the price of apartments to rise for locals. Spain is the second most visited country after France. It is also on Europe’s list for top market hotel investment.  The hotels are also said to be better for quality and labor rights than short rentals since there is more transparency.

New Zealand will be more expensive for tourists to visit starting next month. New Zealand is [raising its tourist tax](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/new-zealand-tripling-its-tourist-tax-intl-hnk/index.html) from 22 USD to 62 USD.

The company's Chief executive has said, "The economic environment has worsened, and new competitors are pushing towards Europe.” It is currently not in the best place.
