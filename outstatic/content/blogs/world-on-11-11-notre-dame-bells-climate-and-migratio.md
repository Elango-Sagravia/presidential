### What happened on 11/11?

![Veterans Day in the US](/images/11_11-c5MT.webp)

In the US, Veterans Day honors all military veterans. In 2024, [Veterans Day](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/09/what-is-veterans-day-2024/76095394007/) falls on a Monday, with many government services closed but businesses offering discounts for veterans. It used to be Armistice Day to mark the [1918 World War I armistice](https://www.abmc.gov/multimedia/videos/day-history-november-11-1918-world-war-i-ends). It became a federal holiday in 1938. 1954, the name was changed to Veterans Day to recognize all living and deceased veterans. European countries like the UK, Belgium, and France still observe Armistice Day or [Remembrance Day](https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/remembrance/about-remembrance).

In some other European countries, [St. Martin’s Day](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/german-expat-news/history-saint-martins-day), celebrated on November 11, honors Saint Martin of Tours, known for his acts of kindness and compassion. In countries like Germany, traditions include lantern processions, bonfires, and feasts, particularly with roast goose. While not a public holiday, it marks the end of harvest and is a time for communities to come together with songs and festivities.

### The bells of Notre Dame

![The bells of Notre Dame](/images/the-bells-of-notre-dame-cathedral-gxMD.webp)

The bells of Notre Dame, a symbol of Paris, [rang for the first time](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241108-bells-notre-dame-cathedral-ring-first-time-since-2019-fire) since the devastating [fire](https://www.friendsofnotredamedeparis.org/notre-dame-cathedral/fire/) in April 2019 that caused significant damage to this historic cathedral. All eight bells chimed in unison for approximately five minutes, creating a resonant sound that filled the air and signified a significant milestone in the ongoing restoration process—this moment marked a return to a cherished tradition and a hopeful step towards the cathedral's revival.

After five years of [restoration work](https://rebatirnotredamedeparis.fr/en), Notre Dame will reopen to the public on December 8, 2024. This significant event will feature ceremonies honoring the cathedral's cultural importance and performances by renowned artists, creating a lively atmosphere. The reopening aims to revitalize this iconic landmark and ensure it remains a cherished destination for generations.

### Extreme weather and migration

New research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that [extreme weather](https://apnews.com/article/us-mexico-migration-climate-change-drought-2716b712e1f87cb66985412f0f7c4c89#:~:text=Scientists%20predict%20migration%20will%20grow,Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change%20report.), especially drought, significantly influences illegal migration from rural Mexico to the U.S. Researchers analyzed data from over 48,000 residents in 84 Mexican farming communities, finding that migration increases during severe droughts. Conversely, extreme wet conditions discourage migrants from returning.

As climate change worsens, migration patterns driven by weather events may become more severe, particularly affecting regions reliant on rain-fed agriculture, such as corn farming. These findings highlight climate change's significant role in [driving displacement](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/08/americas/weather-migration-us-mexico-study/index.html) and potentially dangerous migration routes. The impacts of climate change vary across populations, with vulnerable communities experiencing more significant pressures to migrate due to changing weather patterns. At the same time, those with more resources can adapt more swiftly.
