### Julian Assange to Make First Public Appearance 

![Julian Assange to Make First Public Appearance](/images/julian-assange-makes-first-appearance-since-release-Q0ND.webp)

Julian Assange, the founder of [WikiLeaks](https://wikileaks.org/What-is-WikiLeaks.html), is set to speak at the Council of Europe on October 1, marking his first public appearance since his release from a British jail. His wife, Stella Assange, [announced](https://x.com/Stella_Assange/status/1838682234708193569) on X that he will provide testimony for a committee report on his case and its broader implications. 

After returning to Australia in June, Assange gained his freedom back by pleading guilty to violating U.S. espionage laws, ending a 14-year legal saga. The Council has labeled him a political prisoner and urged the U.S. to investigate claims of inhumane treatment he faced during his detention.

### Missouri Executes Marcellus Williams

Marcellus Williams, convicted of the 1998 murder of Felicia Gayle, was executed in Missouri after the U.S. Supreme Court [denied a stay of execution](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/us/marcellus-williams-missouri-supreme-court-hearing). New DNA evidence suggesting possible contamination and concerns raised by the St. Louis prosecutor cast doubt on the conviction, but the execution proceeded.

Williams maintained his innocence, with support from several jurors and the victim’s family, who advocated for amnesty. Missouri’s Attorney General argued the DNA evidence didn’t conclusively exonerate him, while Governor Mike Parson declined to intervene. The case has renewed debate over the potential for [wrongful executions](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence) in the U.S. justice system.

### Thai King Signs Off on Gay Marriage

Thailand officially [legalized](https://apnews.com/article/thailand-marriage-equality-law-e0df9fa2d38afc81c53dda81ce489be5) same-sex marriage on Tuesday, making it the third in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to do so. The law, endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, will take effect in 120 days and allow LGBTQ+ couples to register their marriages starting in January. The bill, which grants all married partners full legal, financial, and medical rights, passed through both houses of Parliament earlier this year. 

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra hailed the decision as a significant step forward for Thailand, which has long been seen as inclusive despite challenges to marriage equality. This follows another progressive milestone—Thailand’s recent legalization of medical cannabis—marking its shift towards more liberal policies in Southeast Asia.

### The Slovak PM Gets a Bullet in the Mail

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico recently received a bullet in an envelope from an unknown sender, which has led to a police investigation. This unsettling threat follows an [attempted assassination](https://www.politico.eu/article/slovak-prime-minister-robert-fico-in-surgery-after-being-shot-in-politically-motivated-assassination-attempt/) on Fico back in May, which shocked many and underscored the divisions in Slovak society. The shooter is currently facing terrorism charges and could end up in prison for life. After the attack, Fico had to undergo several surgeries for his injuries, and he publicly blamed his political opponents for the incident. 

Many critics have pointed out that Fico's government seems to be adopting tactics similar to those seen in Hungary, targeting the media, [anti-corruption efforts](https://www.politico.eu/article/slovakia-corruption-europe-robert-fico-politics-tv-culture/), and the [LGBTQ+ community](https://www.politico.eu/article/slovak-culture-minister-blames-lgbtq-europe-low-fertility-rates-martina-simkovicova/) while echoing some pro-Kremlin views on the Ukraine war.

### Erdogan Compares Nethyanahu to Hitler at UNGA Debates 

During Tuesday’s U.N. General Assembly session, Turkish President Erdogan controversially [likened](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/turkish-official-defends-president-erdogans-comparison-of-israeli-policies-to-nazi-germany/3340662) Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to Hitler, a comparison he has made multiple times. The U.N. debates had quite a lot of things to say about the situation with Israel and Gaza.

Many world leaders supported this view, criticizing Israel's actions as excessive and harmful to civilians. However, some critics argue that Erdogan's position is weakened by ongoing issues in Turkey regarding minority rights, particularly concerning the Kurds. Additionally, Erdogan's indirect involvement in disputes between Azerbaijan and Armenia raises further concerns for many observers, complicating his stance in these discussions.
