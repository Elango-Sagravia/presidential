### Poland lacks support to legalize abortion

Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, has [admitted](https://www.euronews.com/health/2024/08/24/polish-government-doesnt-have-votes-to-liberalise-strict-abortion-law-says-pm-donald-tusk) that he does not have the support in parliament necessary to change the country's abortion law. Poland has some of the strictest abortion laws in the European Union. One of Tusk’s main promises in his campaign last year was to push to get abortion legal for up to 12 weeks in Poland. Abortion in Poland is only allowed in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother’s life is at risk. In many cases, women are not even allowed to have abortions in these cases. Many doctors in the more conservative parts of Poland refuse them in any of the legal cases.

### Australia gets the right to disconnect

Australia has joined the ranks of some European countries, and employees can’t be punished for [not answering work calls](https://www.dw.com/en/australian-workers-now-have-the-right-to-disconnect/a-70045955#:~:text=Australian%20workers%20will%20now%20have,texts%20outside%20of%20work%20hours.) and emails outside of work hours. The goal is to give Australians a better work balance. There is one main exception to this new law. The law states that employees can only face punishments from their employer if the refusal to answer is deemed "unreasonable". The line between reasonable and unreasonable isn’t precisely laid out and up for interpretation. Employees and employers are encouraged to figure this out themselves. However, the Fair Work Commission will intervene if an agreement can’t be reached.

### Uganda opposition faces terrorism charges

Thirty-six members of Uganda's opposition party, Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), who were charged with [terrorism-related offenses](https://www.dw.com/en/ugandas-opposition-leaders-arrested-charged-with-terrorism/a-70017547) last month, are scheduled to appear in court this week. Court records accuse the 36 people of traveling to Kenya "to provide or receive terrorist training." They are now being held at a prison about 50 kilometers (31 miles) northwest of the capital. They are all sticking by their innocence. Critics have said this is only a way for the ruling Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, to crush down on political opponents. He has led the country for 38 years, and many say he has turned Uganda into a repressive country that punishes all forms of opposition.

On Sunday and Monday morning, hundreds of migrants [swam](https://www.reuters.com/world/dozens-migrants-swim-into-spains-ceuta-enclave-morocco-2024-08-26/) to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. Spain has two enclaves on Morocco's Mediterranean coast, Ceuta and Melilla; they share the only land borders of the European Union with Africa. This has become a popular path for some refugees to enter the European Union without crossing the Mediterranean. However, it's only possible sometimes. It depends a lot on the mist. It’s a strongly guarded area that must be thicker on days and times. It is still a challenging swim, and some have died from doing this. It is not always guaranteed that they will get to stay, even if they are successful. Moroccan nationals are sent back most of the time.

### France celebrates 100 years of liberation

Paris held a big [celebration](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/08/26/world/paris-80th-anniversary-wwii/) on Sunday, celebrating 80 years of liberation from the Nazis. On Aug. 25, 1944, the 2nd French Armored Division entered the capital, ending 1,500 days of German occupation. A parade followed the direction of the French division from the south of the capital to its center. The French Air Force made a dramatic flyover in Paris. The torch for the Paralympics, which starts on Wednesday, was also lit and is now making its way around Paris. Macron said, "Beyond all divisions and contradictions, to be French is to be together.” This day comes when many elements of French society and politics are divided in many different directions.

### Iceland Cave collapses

One is dead, and two are missing after an [ice cave in Iceland collapsed](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/26/europe/ice-cave-collapse-iceland-intl-hnk/index.html) on Sunday. Another additional person has been medically evacuated by helicopter. When it collapsed, 25 tourists from several countries were visiting the cave at the Breidamerkurjokull glacier in southeastern Iceland. Luckily, most of the tourists were outside the cave and accompanied by a guide. Ice caves are one of the main tourist highlights in Iceland. Iceland has been subject to some natural disasters in the past week. Just last Friday, a volcano also erupted.

### Brazil deals with wildfires

Brazil’s largest state, Sao Paulo, has reported battling blazing [wildfires.](https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-authorities-declare-war-on-blazing-wildfires/a-70045441) Two industrial workers died trying to fight off the flames over the weekend. In addition, many schools are closed, and transport routes are interrupted—the main cause of the wildfires is the weather. Brazil is at its peak during the dry season when humidity is low, and temperatures are high. There is also a significant drought going on. However, while this is the dry season, it is still not a regular thing for Brazil. The government statistics report that this summer has been usual. Brazil’s rainforest has been dealing with fires at the highest rate in two decades.
