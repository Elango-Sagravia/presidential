### The Elon Musk effect

![Elon Musk has played a significant role in Donald Trump’s return to the White House](/images/musk-s-influence-on-us-elections-M0Nz.webp)

Elon Musk has played a [significant role](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/11/7/the-elon-musk-effect-how-donald-trump-gained-from-billionaires-support) in Donald Trump’s return to the White House by using his influence and wealth to support Trump’s campaign and promote right-wing messaging on social media. Musk donated over $132 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign, and his platform, X (formerly Twitter), has become an unofficial outlet for pro-Trump narratives.

Musk's promotion of Trump included controversial initiatives, such as a [cash giveaway](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/04/politics/elon-musk-1-million-giveaway/index.html) for petition signers in crucial swing states, which faced legal scrutiny. Once considered a liberal icon, Musk's [views](https://www.techpolicy.press/tracking-elon-musks-political-activities/) have shifted to the right due to personal experiences and business conflicts, aligning him with Trump’s appeal to young men and attracting criticism from the other side for amplifying misinformation.

### Australia on social media

!["Australia proposes a minimum age of 16 for social media use](/images/australia-to-legislate--world-leading--social-media-ban-for-children-under-16-A4OT.webp)

Australia is [proposing legislation](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5182775/australia-social-media-ban-children) to set a minimum age of 16 for social media use, with companies responsible for enforcement. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the move, saying it aims to protect young people from online harms. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook would have one year to implement measures and face penalties for non-compliance.

Critics, including mental health advocates, argue the law could drive underage users underground, cutting them off from online support. Instead, they suggest age-appropriate spaces and [digital literacy programs](https://www.mediapoweryouth.org/navigating-mental-health-advocacy-on-social-media/). The opposition has shown in-principle support, believing platforms can enforce the restrictions with existing technology. The government plans to exempt cases requiring educational access, with enforcement led by Australia’s eSafety Commissioner.

### "How to move to Scotland”

Following [Donald Trump’s victory](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/how-donald-trump-won/index.html) over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, there has been a notable increase in Americans expressing interest in emigrating. This shift is rooted in concerns about the future of critical rights and policies, including reproductive freedom, immigration reform, and protections for minorities and LGBTQ+ communities. Many Americans woke up on November 6 to contemplate leaving the U.S., with Google searches for [“How to move to Scotland”](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/how-to-immigrate-scotland-surge-google-searches-elections) spiking overnight to record levels. This trend is particularly strong in Oregon, Colorado, Washington, Kentucky, and Missouri.

The search interest extends beyond Scotland; Americans also explore options in New Zealand, Ireland, and other countries, particularly those that provide strong social protections and align with progressive values. People have also shown interest in Scotland’s policies, such as abortion rights and protections for transgender individuals, suggesting that social policies are a critical factor in these considerations.
