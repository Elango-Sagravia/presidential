### **Georgia County Equips Election Workers with Panic Buttons**

To bolster election worker safety, Cobb County in Georgia has allocated $47,250 to provide about 200 panic buttons before the presidential election. These devices, sourced from Runbeck Election Services and Response Technologies, help workers contact authorities quickly by sending GPS locations when activated.

Costing $150 to $250 annually, the devices can alert either election authorities or law enforcement. The partnership between Runbeck and Response Technologies has generated interest across several states, reflecting growing concern over election worker safety.

This move comes as nearly 40% of election workers reported threats, harassment, or abuse this year. With former President Trumpâ€™s claims about election fraud fueling fears, states are increasing security measures, including enhanced training and better communication tools.

Despite Cobb County's adoption of the system, other regions like Gwinnett County are cautious due to potential false alarms and implementation issues. Former Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman emphasizes that effective training is crucial for these devices to be reliable.
