### Georgia County Equips Election Workers with Panic Buttons

To bolster election worker safety, Cobb County in Georgia has allocated $47,250 to provide about 200 panic buttons before the presidential election. These devices, sourced from Runbeck Election Services and Response Technologies, help workers contact authorities quickly by sending GPS locations when activated.

Costing $150 to $250 annually, the devices can alert either election authorities or law enforcement. The partnership between Runbeck and Response Technologies has generated interest across several states, reflecting growing concern over election worker safety.

This move comes as nearly 40% of election workers reported threats, harassment, or abuse this year. With former President Trump’s claims about election fraud fueling fears, states are increasing security measures, including enhanced training and better communication tools.

Despite Cobb County's adoption of the system, other regions like Gwinnett County are cautious due to potential false alarms and implementation issues. Former Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman emphasizes that effective training is crucial for these devices to be reliable.

### Supreme Court Blocks Biden’s Education Rule Enforcement

The Supreme Court on Friday halted the Biden administration from enforcing portions of a significant education regulation amid ongoing litigation over its protections for transgender students. The court rejected the administration’s request to allow less controversial aspects of the rule, which do not pertain to gender identity, to be implemented in states where the regulation is being challenged.

The regulation, finalized by the Education Department in April, includes measures for transgender students and other provisions related to pregnant and postpartum individuals. While the rule’s enforcement remains blocked in 22 states that have challenged it, states that did not contest the regulation will continue to be covered.

Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, dissented from the majority's order. They argued that blocking enforcement of unchallenged provisions burdens the government more than necessary.

The Supreme Court’s decision follows lawsuits filed in Kentucky and Louisiana, where federal judges blocked the entire regulation. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar contended that the injunctions were overly broad, as they blocked provisions not directly challenged by the plaintiffs.

### Southern Africa Faces Severe Drought Due to El Niño

Southern Africa is grappling with a severe drought affecting 68 million people, as reported by the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The drought, which began in early 2024, has devastated crops and livestock, leading to widespread food shortages and economic damage.

SADC leaders are meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, to address the crisis, with 17% of the region’s population requiring aid. This El Niño event, combined with rising temperatures from greenhouse gases, is the worst drought the region has faced in years.

Countries like Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi have declared the situation a state of disaster, while Lesotho and Namibia seek humanitarian support. Despite a $5.5 billion appeal for assistance launched in May, funding has been insufficient, prompting renewed calls for help from both regional and international partners.

The drought is a key topic at the summit, alongside the ongoing conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which continues to be a significant concern for the region.

### X Shuts Down Brazil Operations Over Judge’s Orders

Media platform X has announced it is closing its operations in Brazil immediately, citing alleged “censorship orders” from Brazilian judge Alexandre de Moraes. X claims Moraes threatened to arrest a company representative if it did not comply with orders to remove certain content, backed by a document showing a daily fine and arrest decree.

Brazil’s Supreme Court, where Moraes serves, has declined to comment on the matter. Despite the closure, X remains accessible to Brazilian users. Earlier this year, Moraes had directed X to block specific accounts linked to misinformation, prompting a conflict with billionaire owner Elon Musk, who labeled Moraes’ actions as “unconstitutional.”

Musk has criticized the judge’s decisions and accused him of imposing secret censorship demands. X had previously promised to comply with Brazilian court orders but faced challenges with operational faults in implementing them.

### London’s Somerset House Fire Under Control

A fire at Somerset House in London has been brought under control with the help of around 125 firefighters. The blaze, which affected the building's roof, prompted a significant response, including the use of a 64-meter aerial ladder. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but there have been no reports of injuries.

Somerset House has announced it will remain closed until further notice. The Courtauld Gallery, located within the building and housing priceless art, was not directly impacted and will stay open. The London Fire Brigade is continuing its operations and investigating the fire’s origin.

### Egg Prices Surge Amid Bird Flu Outbreak

Egg prices have been rising for three consecutive months, driven by a persistent outbreak of avian influenza (bird flu). In July, prices surged 19.1% year-over-year, outpacing the general consumer price index, which rose only 2.9%.

The bird flu, which had a significant impact in 2022 and resurfaced in late 2023, continues to disrupt supply, particularly in Colorado and California. This has led to noticeable price increases for eggs, though prices remain over 20% below last year’s highs.

Despite these fluctuations, egg demand remains relatively stable due to its inelastic nature—consumers buy similar quantities regardless of price changes. Looking forward, the stability of egg prices will largely depend on the future trajectory of the bird flu outbreaks.

### FDA Approves First At-Home Syphilis Test

The FDA has authorized the first over-the-counter at-home test for detecting syphilis antibodies, developed by NOWDiagnostics. This test, which provides results in about 15 minutes, aims to increase initial screening rates for syphilis, especially among those hesitant to visit healthcare providers.

However, the FDA cautions that the test results are not conclusive for diagnosis and should be confirmed with additional testing. With syphilis cases in the U.S. rising by 80% from 2018 to 2022, the new test offers a critical tool for early detection and prevention of severe health outcomes associated with the disease.

### Caitlin Clark Leads Fever to Win Over Mercury

Caitlin Clark, fresh off a month-long Olympic break, led the Indiana Fever to a 98-89 win over the Phoenix Mercury, scoring 29 points and dishing out 10 assists. Clark's strong performance, including 13 points in the first quarter and four 3-pointers, helped the Fever withstand a late surge from the Mercury, who were hampered by fatigue and foul trouble.

The game featured brief scuffles and highlighted a brewing rivalry between Clark and Diana Taurasi. Despite the Mercury's effort to close the gap, the Fever's balanced attack, including notable contributions from Kelsey Mitchell and Aliyah Boston, secured their third consecutive win over Phoenix this season.
