### THE BIG ONE

**Cleared of charges**

![](/images/weekend-purple-M0NT.webp)

A federal judge has [dismissed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jack-smith-dismiss-charges-trump-d-c-election-case/) charges in the 2020 election case against President-elect Donald Trump following a [request](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.281.0_5.pdf) from special counsel Jack Smith. Smith cited Justice Department policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president, regardless of the allegations’ gravity. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan approved dismissing the case without prejudice, allowing it to be refiled after Trump leaves office in 2029.

Trump’s team hailed the decision as a victory for justice, while critics pointed to the policy’s impact on accountability. Smith, who led investigations into Trump’s conduct, is expected to file a final report and resign. The decision ended federal prosecution but left ongoing [state cases](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/25/trump-legal-cases-status) in Georgia and New York. Trump’s [plans](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9zjl2d3m7o) to appoint key legal allies to the Justice Department raise questions about future case handling.

### RECAP

**Native American Heritage Month**

Native American Heritage Month is [celebrated](https://www.today.com/life/holidays/when-is-native-american-heritage-month-rcna178125) every November to honor the contributions of Native American peoples in the U.S. It provides a platform for sharing their cultural heritage and contemporary lives. It also serves as a way to honor the contributions of Native Americans in many aspects of US culture and livelihood [(see photos)](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/28/in-photos-native-american-heritage-month). Established in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush’s proclamation, evolved from “American Indian Week” in 1986. The month coincides with Thanksgiving, which represents colonization for many Native Americans. Activities include powwows, storytelling, and cultural exhibitions to promote a broader understanding of Native experiences.

**Germany needs workers**

Germany is experiencing a significant [labor shortage](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-needs-288000-foreign-workers-annually-until-2040-study/a-70885279#:~:text=Germany%3A%20288%2C000%20foreign%20workers%20needed%20annually%20until%202040,-11%2F26%2F2024&text=Despite%20recent%20reforms%20to%20labor,to%20be%20filled%20by%20immigrants.), projected to worsen due to a shrinking workforce, which could decline by 10% by 2040. The Bertelsmann Foundation estimates that Germany will need around 288,000 skilled immigrant workers annually and possibly up to 368,000 by 2060. Despite [reforms to labor migration laws](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-new-immigration-law-promises-easier-visa-process/a-66000520) in 2023, barriers and discrimination remain, hindering the attraction of skilled workers. Regions like [Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Saxony-Anhalt,+Germany/@51.9841583,10.5549464,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47a5f099e8512481:0xd11dc516e80ede74!8m2!3d51.9502649!4d11.6922734!16zL20vMDlocmM?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEyNC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) will face the most challenges, while cities like Berlin and Hamburg may be less impacted due to higher immigration levels. While immigration remains a hot issue in Germany, it turns out that immigrants are still needed. 

**Lost hiker found**

What began as a routine workday in northeast British Columbia became an [incredible rescue](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/27/americas/canada-british-columbia-lost-hiker-intl-latam/index.html) when two men found hiker Sam Benastick, missing for over a month. Last seen on October 17 after starting a 10-day camping trip, he was discovered weak but alive, using two walking sticks and a makeshift sleeping bag for warmth. Benastick had spent weeks in the wilderness, initially in his car, then camping by a creek, and finally in a dried-out creek bed. Despite suffering from frostbite and smoke inhalation, he was rescued and taken to the hospital, reuniting with his relieved family.

### THE BIG QUESTION

**What can get more expensive with Trump's new tariffs?** 

Many voters for Donald Trump did not vote for him because of his MAGA policies and social issues; they voted for him based on [economic factors](https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-economy-immigration-11db37c033328a7ef6af71fe0a104604). However, will these be relieved by his [tariff plans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-tariffs-explained), particularly the ones he plans to have with China, Mexico, and Canada, the US's largest trading partners? 

President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada could significantly [impact American consumers](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/26/business/tariffs-mexico-canada-more-expensive/index.html). Gas prices could rise by 25 to 75 cents per gallon as the U.S. imports much of its oil from Canada. Food prices would also increase, especially for items like avocados, which the U.S. imports heavily from Mexico. Cars and car parts from Mexico, valued at nearly $45 billion in 2023, would become more expensive, affecting manufacturers and consumers. Alcohol imports, including Mexican beer and tequila, would also increase prices. With Mexico now the [U.S.’s top trading partner](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2024/02/07/2023-results-are-in-us-has-new-top-port-trade-partner-export-import/), these tariffs would disrupt supply chains, leading to higher costs for a wide range of goods, ultimately burdening U.S. consumers and businesses.

Donald Trump was democratically elected and will have a chance to prove himself to voters in January. So, many of his plans and effectiveness remain to be seen. However, when examining the impact of tariffs, it seems that the “voters for economic reasons” did not have this in mind when casting a vote.
