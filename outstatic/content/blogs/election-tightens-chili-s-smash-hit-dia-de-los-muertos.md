### THE BIG ONE

### Swing states neck and neck

The U.S. election is just a few days away, and the polls indicate very little. Kamala Harris is slightly ahead in the overall popular vote. However, the key swing states are too close to call, with both candidates [either tied](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/30/harris-wisconsin-michigan-pennsylvania-trump-2024/75941604007/) or leading by just one point in these critical areas. Many are questioning the [accuracy of the polls](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/30/us-presidential-election-2024-how-accurate-are-the-polls), especially in light of the 2016 and 2020 elections, during which Trump consistently trailed in the polls. This year, the polling methodology has been adjusted to improve accuracy, but the margin of error remains around 4%.

Both candidates made their final arguments this week: Harris spoke on Tuesday at the [Ellipse](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/kamala-harris-ellipse-rally/index.html), while Trump held a major rally in New York’s Madison Square Gardens [(see write-up)](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/largest-lake-shrinking-gerard-depardieu-trial-trump-rally). Trump and Harris will put their efforts into [Arizona and Nevada](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-10-31-24/index.html) this weekend. There is still a lot that can happen.

### RECAP

**Chili’s smash hit**

Chili’s parent company, Brinker International, [reported a 14% increase](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/30/food/chilis-earnings/index.html) in same-store sales and a 6.5% rise in traffic, driven by popular menu items like the $10.99 Big Smasher burger and the Triple Dipper platter. The Big Smasher, a new answer to McDonald’s Big Mac, has proven incredibly successful, prompting its extension through next year. Chili’s $6 margaritas also contributed to its appeal. In contrast, competitors like TGI Fridays face challenges, including recent closures and financial struggles.

**Día de los Muertos**

This Saturday, the Día de Los Muertos vigil on the U.S.-Mexico border, [organized](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/31/day-of-the-dead-history/75891131007/) by the Border Network for Human Rights, will feature a 10-foot skeleton puppets meeting in the middle of the Rio Grande. The event honors migrants who have lost their lives while crossing the border. It is part of a growing trend of using Día de Los Muertos to contemplate social issues worldwide, including migrant rights and police brutality.

**Triplet births**

A recent CDC report shows a significant [62% decline](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/31/health/triplets-birth-less-common-united-states-cdc-wellness/index.html) in triplet and higher-order births in the U.S. between 1998 and 2023, particularly among women over 30. This decrease is because of changes in fertility treatment practices and significantly stricter guidelines on embryo transfers in IVF to reduce pregnancy risks. The trend benefits maternal and infant health by reducing complications associated with multiple births. However, racial disparities persist, as Black mothers have seen only modest declines in high-order births due to varying access to advanced reproductive technologies.
