### Spanish floods

![Severe flash floods in eastern Spain kill at least 158 and devastate the Valencia region](/images/spanish-floods-in-europe-have-killed-almost-100-kzMj.jpg)

This week, eastern Spain was devastated by severe flash floods that have [killed at least 158](https://www.dw.com/en/spain-floods-death-toll-climbs-as-rescuers-seek-survivors/a-70646793) and caused extensive damage across the region. The floods primarily impacted the [Valencia region](https://www.britannica.com/place/Valencia-autonomous-area-Spain), where torrential downpours led to significant destruction. Over 150,000 households were left without electricity, further complicating rescue efforts and worsening the crisis. Local officials are [criticized ](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-floods-valencia-europe-climate-change-preparation/)for their lagging response in issuing alerts to warn residents about the impending disaster, raising concerns about readiness for extreme weather disasters.

Heavy floodwaters resulted from a strong storm, made worse by rising sea temperatures linked to [climate change](https://www.dw.com/en/in-the-aftermath-of-flooding-in-spain-and-elsewhere-5-charts-to-help-explain-climate-science-v2/a-69289787). Emergency teams, including military personnel, are searching for missing people in the affected areas and trying to find and help anyone who might still be trapped or in danger. As communities start to assess the damage and plan for recovery, the effects of climate change are a key topic for both officials and residents.

### NYC jaywalking

![New York City to decriminalize jaywalking in February, allowing pedestrians to cross streets outside crosswalks](/images/new-yorkers-can-legally-jaywalk-now-k1Mj.jpg)

From February on, New York City will [decriminalize](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/jaywalking-legalized-in-nyc/) jaywalking, allowing pedestrians to cross streets outside crosswalks without fines or criminal penalties. The change aims to address racial disparities in jaywalking citations, which have [disproportionately](https://www.reckon.news/news/2024/05/nypd-disproportionately-cited-people-of-color-for-jaywalking-in-2023-mirroring-racist-enforcement-nationwide.html) impacted Black and Latino residents even though it's a common thing for most New Yorkers. When enforced, more than [90% of tickets](https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-officially-decriminalizes-jaywalking-ending-a-66-year-ban-that-was-scarcely-enforced/), costing up to $250, were issued to Black and Latino New Yorkers.

Council member Mercedes Narcisse, who sponsored the bill, stated that the law shifts police focus away from minor offenses and promotes fair and equitable enforcement. It also frees up many legal and financial resources for patrolling these minor offenses. However, pedestrians who cross outside designated crosswalks won’t have the right of way, emphasizing the shared responsibility for safety among all road users.

### Dia de los Muertos

Today, many Mexicans and the Mexican diaspora observe [Dia de los Muertos](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/10/28/day-of-the-dead-dia-de-los-muertos-visual-guide/75790458007/), or Day of the Dead, celebrated from October 31 to November 2. It honors departed loved ones with rituals blending Aztec and Catholic [traditions](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/top-ten-day-of-dead-mexico). Key symbols include the ofrenda, or altar, which holds offerings like food, flowers, and sugar skulls, thought to nourish spirits with their “essence.” Skeletons playfully depict life after death, while alebrijes, colorful mythical creatures, serve as spirit guides.

Thirty-seven million Americans have some kind of Mexican heritage. The holiday initially stemmed from the [Oaxaca region of Mexico](https://www.axios.com/local/salt-lake-city/2023/11/01/dia-los-muertos-day-dead-latinos) but became popular among Mexican communities in the 1970s thanks to the [Chicano movement](https://www.history.com/news/chicano-movement). This was a way to help Mexican Americans embrace Mexican culture and overcome the shame they felt over widespread racism.
