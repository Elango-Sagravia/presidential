### Hurricane Milton Hits Land

![Hurricane Milton strikes Florida as a Category 3 storm](/images/hurricane-milton-lashing-florida-c5NT.webp)

[Hurricane Milton](https://apnews.com/article/milton-florida-hurricane-d40b1e47fd78844bf1ed528bab5099f1) made landfall in Florida as a [Category 3 storm](https://apnews.com/article/what-is-hurricane-causes-facts-0656324870cb2032e267e65546e04c93), striking near Siesta Key with winds of 120 mph, causing widespread damage and power outages. Multiple tornadoes hit the state, and over 1 million homes lost power, particularly in Sarasota and Manatee counties. Flooding and deadly storm surges affect areas like Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Fort Myers. Many residents faced evacuation orders, while others chose to hunker down, bracing for further impacts from the storm’s heavy rains and potential flooding across the state.

With over seven weeks left in the [2024 Atlantic hurricane season](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/10/09/is-there-a-hurricane-after-milton-brewing-latest-forecast/75584148007/), Hurricane Milton might not be the last storm to affect the U.S. this year. Forecasters are monitoring additional systems, including one near Florida that could become Tropical Storm Nadine. Another system, [Hurricane Leslie](https://www.lagrangenews.com/2024/10/09/wednesday-oct-9-update-latest-on-category-1-hurricane-leslie-from-the-nhc/), continues in the open Atlantic, and a tropical wave off Africa’s coast could develop as it moves across the Atlantic. 

### Walz Says the Electoral College Needs to Go

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has renewed calls to [replace the Electoral College](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/08/walz-says-the-electoral-college-needs-to-go-00182981) with a national popular vote, suggesting it’s necessary for accurate democratic representation. Speaking at a campaign fundraiser, he acknowledged that while this isn’t the current reality, he sees the move needed for the future. 

Walz has been traveling to swing states to support Vice President Kamala Harris. Still, his comments have stirred concerns among campaign officials, reminding some of past elections where the popular vote didn’t determine the presidency. Despite his stance, this isn’t an official campaign position. Though the [Electoral College](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/biden-supports-taiwan-hezbollah-vows-to-fight) is deeply embedded in the U.S. system, movements to reform or abolish it continue to gain traction in some political circles.

### X Returning to Brazil 

![Brazil's Supreme Court lifts suspension on X, owned by Elon Musk, after legal compliance](/images/x-reinstated-in-brazil-Y3OD.webp)

After being shut down for over a month, the Brazilian Supreme Court has allowed the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to [resume operations](https://apnews.com/article/brazil-x-elon-musk-supreme-court-de-moraes-e32c4b4171e78cbe8994f53713a922f7). Justice Alexandre de Moraes had ordered the [suspension on August 30](https://apnews.com/video/brazil-government-elon-musk-courts-brazil-censorship-46bd73bfb66c49ed844ca1da0c19b900), stating that X had failed to comply with legal requirements, such as blocking certain accounts and appointing a legal representative. Despite criticism from Elon Musk, who called him authoritarian, X eventually met the court's demands.

The platform's return follows its commitment to obey Brazilian laws and court rulings. However, experts have observed that X has had limited activity compared to companies like Meta and Google, which have offices in the country. Some users have switched to alternatives like Bluesky, but X aims to regain its position in the Brazilian market.

### Hurricane Helene Might Affect US Presidential Election

One of the main afterthoughts of Helene’s havoc across the Southeast is how it affects critical swing states like Georgia and North Carolina. Both states are pushing forward with voting, though it’s unclear how the displacement and destruction will impact voter turnout and accessibility. The hardest-hit areas were largely [Trump-supporting regions in 2020](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/g-s1-27169/hurricane-helene-georgia-north-carolina-trump-2020), raising questions about how this might shift voting dynamics. Trump and Vice President Harris both visited the region, with Trump criticizing the Biden administration’s [federal aid response](https://apnews.com/article/helene-hurricane-damage-fema-trump-biden-harris-e5c1feed690765bac4d7096ce9dceb96) and using the situation to campaign ahead of the upcoming election.

While Biden won Georgia, the 53 counties impacted by the hurricane heavily favored Trump, who secured over 57% of the vote in those areas during the 2020 election. Trump won North Carolina in 2020, but Biden’s support in heavily Democratic Mecklenburg County may become essential. [Recent polling](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4x71znwxdo) shows Kamala Harris is slightly ahead, but it's still too close a margin to call.
