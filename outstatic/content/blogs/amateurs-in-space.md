### First Non-Professional Walks in Space

Jared Isaacman made history on Thursday by becoming the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space. As part of the [Polaris mission](https://polarisprogram.com/), Isaacman was accompanied by three other civilians, including Sarah Gillis, who became the first non-professional woman to perform a spacewalk. The mission is a significant milestone in civilian space exploration, with private individuals now contributing to feats that were once only achieved by professional astronauts.

This achievement brings the total number of people to have walked in space to just 260. The Polaris mission is far from over, as the crew plans to ascend higher than any human has since the Apollo missions of the 1970s. Reflecting on the experience, Isaacman remarked, "Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here Earth sure looks like a perfect world".

### Ohio Father Tells Trump To Stop Using Son for Political Gain

Nathan Clark, a father from Springfield, Ohio, has [publicly asked](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/11/trump-vance-ohio-aiden-clark) Donald Trump to stop using his son’s death for political purposes. Clark’s son tragically died in a bus accident caused by a Haitian migrant. While the migrant was sentenced to 13 years in prison, Clark insists the incident was an accident, not murder, as Trump has implied in his political speeches.

Clark accused Trump and Senate candidate J.D. Vance of spreading false information, turning his son’s death into a political tool. The tragedy has been surrounded by misinformation, with wild claims spreading in the area, including rumors that migrants are harming pets. Springfield, Ohio, received around 10,000 Haitian migrants in the last few years.

### Australian Military Commanders Stripped of Medals

Several Australian military commanders have been stripped of their medals due to allegations of war crimes committed in Afghanistan. The decision follows the [Brereton Report](https://apnews.com/article/australia-war-crimes-new-zealand-7d73ce2ff249f70fb19c1c4fd522785a), which investigated misconduct by Australian forces between 2005 and 2014. Defense Minister Richard Marles described the report’s findings as "the most serious allegations of Australian war crimes in our history."

The identities of the commanders have not been publicly released due to Australia’s strict privacy laws. The action is part of a broader investigation into Australian military conduct during the Afghanistan war, as the country grapples with the fallout of these allegations.

### Eiffel Tower Olympic Rings Sparks Dispute

![Eiffel Tower with Olympic rings causes controversy](/images/eiffel-family-wants-the-olympic-rings-off-the-eiffel-tower-M1MD.webp)

The descendants of Gustave Eiffel are in a [dispute](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240909-eiffel-family-will-fight-olympic-rings-staying-on-paris-tower) with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo over the Olympic rings currently displayed on the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel family argues that the colorful rings detract from the tower’s iconic design and want them removed by the end of 2024, following the conclusion of the Paris Olympics.

Mayor Hidalgo insists the rings will stay, but the final decision rests with French President Emmanuel Macron, as the Eiffel Tower is state property. The controversy has sparked debate in Paris, with some defending the Olympic tribute and others siding with the Eiffel family’s concerns.

### Former Controversial Peruvian President Fujimori Dies

Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has [died at the age of 86](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240909-eiffel-family-will-fight-olympic-rings-staying-on-paris-tower) after a battle with cancer. Fujimori, who served from 1990 to 2000, left behind a polarizing legacy. He is credited with stabilizing Peru's economy during a turbulent period, but his tenure was also marked by human rights abuses and authoritarian rule.

Fujimori spent his later years in prison for authorizing death squads that killed civilians during his presidency. Though he received a medical pardon in 2017, it was overturned in 2019. Despite his controversial past, Fujimori maintained that all his actions were taken in the best interests of Peru.
