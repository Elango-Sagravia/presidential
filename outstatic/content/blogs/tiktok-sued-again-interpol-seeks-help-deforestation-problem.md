### More Than a Dozen States Are Suing TikTok

![More Than a Dozen States Are Suing TikTok](/images/more-than-a-dozen-states--led-by-california-and-new-york--are-suing-tiktok-IwMz.webp)

Over a dozen states, led by California and New York, are [suing TikTok](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/g-s1-26823/states-sue-tiktok-child-safety-mental-health), claiming the app misled users about its safety and worsened the teen mental health crisis by promoting addictive features. They argue TikTok’s endless scrolling, beauty filters, and notifications keep young users hooked, contributing to issues like body image problems and depression.

The states are pushing for the app to change its design and are seeking financial penalties. TikTok denies the claims, stating they’ve added safety features like screen-time limits and private accounts for minors, though states argue these efforts fall short. Beyond mental health concerns, TikTok has long faced scrutiny for its [ties to China](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64797355) and potential data privacy issues, with some U.S. lawmakers pushing for an outright [ban of the app](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53476117). The outcome of these lawsuits could significantly impact TikTok's operations in the U.S.

### Interpol Seeks the Public’s Help

Interpol has expanded its [“Identify Me”](https://www.interpol.int/en/What-you-can-do/Identify-Me) campaign, releasing details on 46 cold cases involving murdered or unidentified women in six European countries. These cases, some dating back decades, include victims found in forests, bags, and hotel rooms. The campaign, launched in May 2023, previously helped identify one woman within days and has generated around 1,800 tips.

This time, Interpol has released details typically kept confidential, including facial reconstructions and forensic data, to solicit new leads. The initiative seeks to provide closure to families and justice for victims who have been unidentified for too long. Interpol has made parts of its "Black Notice" alerts public for the first time, typically reserved for law enforcement agencies. The hope is that these public efforts will generate new information and help crack these decades-old cases.

### Deforestation Worsens is 2023

![](/images/2023-deforestation-goal-not-met--1--Y2MT.webp)

A 2023 report by the [Forest Declaration Assessment](https://forestdeclaration.org/resources/forest-declaration-assessment-2024/) revealed that 6.37 million hectares of forests were destroyed globally, an area roughly equivalent to the size of Latvia. This marks a worsening trend in deforestation driven primarily by agriculture, commercial logging, and fires, with tropical regions like Brazil, Indonesia, and Bolivia being the most affected. Although Brazil has significantly reduced Amazon deforestation under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s leadership, with a 62% reduction, global efforts remain insufficient.

The world is still far from eliminating deforestation by 2030, and urgent changes are needed in forest protection policies and consumption patterns. The report stressed that forest conservation efforts must be immune to political and economic shifts to ensure long-term success in fighting deforestation and preserving biodiversity.\*\*

### Hurricane Milton Delays President Biden’s International Business

President Joe Biden has [postponed his planned trip](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-angola-germany-hurricane-milton-63e093b3c6f5ecea5dbb5e334dcbd2f9) to Germany and Angola to remain in the U.S. and oversee the federal response to Hurricane Milton *(see [live updates](https://edition.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-milton-florida-10-09-24/index.html))*, a powerful Category 5 storm predicted to devastate the Florida Gulf Coast. Initially scheduled to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin and attend a summit with international leaders, Biden emphasized that it wasn’t the right time to leave the country given the severity of the impending disaster.

Although the president’s trips to Germany and Angola, where he was to [fulfill a promise](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-africa-visit-angola/) to visit Africa, have been delayed, he assured reporters that he still plans to make those visits before his term ends. The White House notified Chancellor Scholz about the cancellation ahead of the announcement, and Biden will work with Germany and Angola to reschedule.
