### Abba tells Trump to stop using their music 

Swedish pop group ABBA joins the club in requesting US Republican president Donald Trump to [stop using their music](https://www.dw.com/en/abba-tell-trump-to-stop-using-their-music-in-campaign/a-70085777) at his election campaign events. A Swedish newspaper picked up on Abba’s music used at a Trump rally in July in Minnesota, which, interestingly enough, has the highest number of Americans of Swedish descent at 7%. The band record company Universal Records requested on their behalf; they simply requested that Trump's campaign stop using the music immediately, and they didn’t have the right or permission to use it.  The band members didn’t comment themselves. Many other artists have also told Trump to stop using their music. Some examples are R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, and Celine Dion.
