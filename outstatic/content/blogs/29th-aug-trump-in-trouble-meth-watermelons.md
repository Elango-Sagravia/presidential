### Space X Commercial spacewalk postponed

Bad weather postponed the Space X launch on Wednesday; the [next attempt](https://www.france24.com/en/science/20240828-spacex-delays-historic-first-private-spacewalk-mission) might be Friday, but that is still up in the air. The launch is for civilians on a privately chartered spaceflight, who will be the first nonprofessional astronauts in history to do a spacewalk. They will get 20 minutes to walk in space if everything goes right. The civilians were training for this for two years. While Space X is owned by Elon Musk, the Polaris mission is funded by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Issacman. The mission was also postponed on Tuesday over a Helium leak.

### New Indictment against Trump

Former US President Donald Trump has again found himself in more legal issues. US prosecutors have issued [revised charges](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdpq4en1vvo) against Trump for attempting to interfere in the 2020 election results. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He has said this is just another attempt to bring back another witch hunt against him. This comes at an exciting time, as the US elections are just over a few months away. It is doubtful that he will have to face these charges in court before election day in November.

The US customs was in for a bit of a shock or maybe even a laugh when it intercepted a watermelon shipment. The shipment was carried by a man driving a commercial tractor-trailer trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico. They uncovered 1,220 packages of methamphetamine wrapped in [watermelon paper](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5090995/watermelon-meth-5-million-san-diego-border-checkpoint), trying to be disguised as fruit. The value is estimated to be around 5 million dollars. The pictures posted online reveal that it is pretty obvious it isn’t a real watermelon. It was not the first time this happened at this border crossing; the officers found a similar shipment in a grocery crate filled with celery.

### Japan prepares for a Typhoon

Japan has issued a [national emergency](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/15/asia/japan-typhoon-ampil-flights-intl-hnk/index.html) for Typhoon Shanshan. Shanshan is expected to approach the Kyushu region, which isn’t far from the Capital, Tokyo. It is continuing to gather more strength. It is expected to reach the equivalent of a category four hurricane. Hundreds of thousands have been ordered to evacuate as soon as possible. Many flights and trains in Japan have been canceled. The storm is expected to weaken on Saturday. The storm shouldn’t cause much damage as the expected path isn’t supposed to hit land. Most of the bad stuff should be wind, rain, and inconvenience. However, these types of storms can have a mind of their own.

According to the Pentagon, the Greek oil tanker stuck last week in the Red Sea is [leaking oil](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/28/greek-oil-tanker-attacked-in-red-sea-leaking-says-pentagon). The vessel is carrying about one million barrels of crude oil. The Yemeni Houthi group struck the ship. The ship was stuck last week and has been on fire ever since. The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group. They have been targeting ships in the Red Sea since the situation with Israel and Palestine escalated. However, many say this is self-sabotage, as if the oil tanker leaks, it would be an ecological disaster for Yemen and the surrounding countries.

### Indian police fire tear gas at demonstrators

Protests in Kolkotta, India, have continued escalating in the last few weeks. The protests are the result of the rape and murder of an Indian female doctor earlier this month. The issue of violence towards women and lack of accountability from the proper authorities have been a hot issue, and this incident was the [last straw](https://www.dw.com/en/india-kolkata-protests-turn-violent-after-doctors-rape-and-murder/a-70061999) for many. The authorities only detained one suspect, while the family and others are close to certain it was a gang rape. Doctors have been striking, and thousands of protestors are out in the streets; the police this week have been using tear gas and water cannons at the protestors; they also arrested some student protestors.

### New Venice to Brussels night train

A new sleeper car route from [Venice to Brussels](https://www.eunews.it/en/2024/08/21/from-brussels-to-venice-a-new-european-night-train-is-coming/#:~:text=The%20new%20route%2C%20created%20by,12%2Dhour%2Dlong%20journey.) is expected to launch in the winter. It is aimed towards winter holiday goers and skiers. It will stop in Antwerp, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Cologne, Munich, Innsbruck, and Verona, crossing the Alps. This is part of the boom of increased sleeper cars in Europe. Due to increased demand, more night trains within Western and Central Europe have been popping up in recent years. Flying is becoming less popular due to environmental concerns, and many find flying a hassle. However, these railway companies still have to find ways to compete and lower their price with many budget airlines.
