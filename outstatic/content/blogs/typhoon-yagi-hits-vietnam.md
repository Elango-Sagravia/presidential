### Typhoon Yagi Strikes Northern Vietnam

Typhoon Yagi, a menacing typhoon that hit Southeast Asia, has finally been downgraded to a tropical depression. Its last victim was [Northern Vietnam](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/typhoon-yagi-weakens-after-hitting-vietnams-capital-hanoi-2024-09-08/). The storm caused widespread flooding and landslides, particularly affecting the capital city, Hanoi. The death toll in Vietnam has risen to 21 as rescue efforts continue.

Yagi also caused much damage in the Philippines and southern China earlier. This summer has been hotter than usual all over the world. These record-breaking temperatures are a culprit in the rising water temperatures that have caused these severe typhoons in the Pacific.

### Trump Sentencing Delayed Until After Election

Former President Donald Trump's [sentencing](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/judge-delays-trumps-sentencing/index.html) has been delayed until November 26, 2024, following his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The judge moved the sentencing date to avoid influencing the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.

Trump was convicted in May for covering up a hush money payment, and while he faces a maximum penalty of four years in prison, many believe he is unlikely to receive the harshest sentence. The potential complexity of presidential immunity should he win re-election adds another layer of uncertainty to the case.

### Venezuelan Police Surround Argentine Embassy

Venezuelan police have surrounded the Argentine embassy in Caracas, which is currently sheltering [six opposition figures](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c207958pp9qo). Argentina severed diplomatic ties with Venezuela following the disputed July elections, and Brazil has since taken over representation of Argentine interests in the country.

This move follows Argentina’s announcement that it will appeal to the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and other officials. The embassy siege reflects the deepening political tensions in Venezuela, with international calls for intervention growing louder.

Climate change activists from the group [Extinction Rebellion](https://www.dw.com/en/climate-protesters-close-off-amsterdams-rijksmuseum/a-70161967) have forced the closure of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum. The protesters, clad in yellow, blocked the entrance and released yellow smoke to draw attention to their cause. The museum cited safety concerns as the reason for its closure, saying it needed to protect staff and artwork.

The group is protesting the museum's sponsorship ties with Dutch bank ING, which they claim finances environmentally harmful projects. While some praise the group for raising awareness, others argue that such actions alienate potential allies, including those who agree with their message.

### Belgrade’s Largest Pride Parade a Success

Belgrade saw its largest and most peaceful pride parade to date, with thousands of participants marching through the city center. [The parade](https://balkaninsight.com/2024/09/07/biggest-ever-belgrade-pride-urges-serbian-authorities-to-boost-lgbtq-rights/), heavily guarded by police, passed government buildings as marchers called for greater LGBTQ rights in Serbia.

In the past, pride events in Belgrade have been marred by violence from counter-protesters, but this year’s event was incident-free. LGBTQ rights remain a contentious issue in Serbia, but there is growing acceptance, particularly in urban areas.

### Ireland Investigates Abuse in Catholic Schools

Ireland has launched a major [investigation](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/04/ireland-to-set-up-inquiry-into-sexual-abuse-at-religious-schools-following-harrowing-repor) into abuse in its Catholic schools, following a pre-investigation that uncovered 2,400 cases and 884 alleged abusers over the last century. Nearly half of the abusers are deceased, but the cases have raised fresh concerns about the legacy of abuse in Irish institutions.

The inquiry was prompted by a 2022 radio documentary that exposed sexual abuse at a prestigious Irish school. While much of the abuse occurred decades ago, some cases are more recent, sparking renewed calls for accountability in a country that has become increasingly progressive in recent years.

### Jordan and Israel Close Borders After West Bank Shooting

Jordan has closed its Allenby Bridge border crossing with the West Bank following the [shooting](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20240908-the-allenby-bridge-crossing-is-the-main-crossing-point-for-palestinians-who-want-to-leave-the-west-bank) of three Israelis. The incident involved a Jordanian national who opened fire near the crossing. Israel, in turn, has closed all three of its borders with Jordan.

The West Bank has seen escalating tensions recently, though Jordan typically maintains diplomatic relations with both Israelis and Palestinians. The Allenby Bridge is the main exit point for Palestinians from the West Bank, making the border closure a significant disruption for the region.
