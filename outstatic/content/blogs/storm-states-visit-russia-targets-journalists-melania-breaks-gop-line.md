### Biden, Harris, and Trump Visit Storm-Ravaged Swing States

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Vice President Kamala Harris, President Biden, and Donald Trump [visited key swing states](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136749/kamala-harris-joe-biden-hurricane-helene-north-carolina-georgia) hit by the storm, including North Carolina and Georgia. Harris visited devastated neighborhoods in Georgia, offering condolences to families affected by the storm, while President Biden flew over North Carolina to survey the damage, assuring residents federal support is on the way.

Biden announced the federal government would cover the full cost of debris removal and emphasized that disasters should bring people together, stating, “There are no Democrats or Republicans—only Americans.” Donald Trump also visited storm-hit areas in Georgia, criticizing Biden for what he called a [slow response](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-hurricane-helene-3097f1706455929adf5a4eb67f9cdf0f) while organizing relief efforts in affected regions. Both Georgia and North Carolina are considered critical in the upcoming elections, adding political significance to these visits.

### Russia Puts Four Journalists on Trial For Extremism

![Russia began the closed-door trial of four independent journalists—Gabov, Karelin, Favorskaya, and Kriger](/images/russia-puts-four-journalists-on-trial-for-extremism-gwNj.webp)

Russia kicked off the [trial of four independent journalists](https://www.dw.com/en/russia-places-four-journalists-on-trial-for-extremism/a-70391268)—Konstantin Gabov, Sergei Karelin, Antonina Favorskaya, and Artem Kriger—who are accused of helping banned groups linked to the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny. This all happened behind closed doors, just seven months after Navalny’s mysterious [death in prison](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/alexei-navalnys-death-what-do-we-know-2024-02-18/). These journalists could face up to six years in prison for being part of an “extremist group.”

When they entered the courtroom, supporters erupted with cheers. Still, after about half an hour, the judge decided to shut down public access, citing fears of “provocations” from Navalny’s supporters. Favorskaya reminded everyone to stay hopeful and warned fellow journalists in Russia to think about leaving, given the increasing repression. However, obtaining the proper visas is tricky for journalists and other activists who want to leave Russia.

### Biden Says He Will Not Back Israel Attacking Iranian Nuclear Sites

President Joe Biden has [rejected any support](https://apnews.com/article/biden-israel-iran-hezbollah-nuclear-sites-846c8779b2b95a3bebcf955c4e69cf6c) for an Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities following recent missile attacks by Iran on Israel. Biden emphasized that the U.S. backs Israel’s right to defend itself but urged for a “proportional” response to Iran’s aggression.

His comments come after Iran fired around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, marking its second attack since April, which Israeli officials interpreted as retaliation for the assassination of the Hezbollah leader. With [tensions rising](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/3rd-oct-world-view-on-iran-israel-conflict-diddy-faces-new-charges), Biden and G7 leaders discussed the possibility of new sanctions against Iran while warning that any retaliation could further escalate the conflict and threaten stability across the Middle East.

### Melania Trump Confirms Support for Abortion Rights

![Melania Trump Confirms Support for Abortion Rights](/images/melania-trump-confirms-support-for-abortion-Q1MD.webp)

In a significant break from her husband’s political stance, Melania Trump has publicly declared her support for abortion rights, aligning with a pro-choice position. In a [video](https://x.com/MELANIATRUMP/status/1841806743216537870) posted on X, she stressed that decisions regarding pregnancy should be made between a woman and her doctor, free from government intervention. Melania’s position contrasts sharply with Donald Trump’s [anti-abortion stance](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/trump-abortion-veto-national-ban-00182091), which aligns with the broader GOP platform.

Her support for abortion rights comes as debates over reproductive freedom heat up in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. Interestingly, her [home country of Slovenia](https://eclj.org/abortion/un/no-state-has-written-a-right-to-abortion-into-its-constitution-except-the-former-yugoslavia), once part of Yugoslavia, was an early adopter of women’s reproductive rights, enshrining them in its constitution. Melania’s stance could complicate Donald Trump’s campaign, given the GOP's firm opposition to abortion.
