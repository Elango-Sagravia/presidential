![Nobel Prize in Medicine Goes to American Biologists](/images/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-two-american-biologists-for-work-on-the-discovery-of-microrna-EwMT.webp)

American scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the 2024 [Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2024/press-release/) for discovering microRNA, tiny genetic regulators in cells that control gene activity. Their groundbreaking research revealed a new mechanism of gene regulation that is essential for all multicellular organisms.

A better understanding of microRNA could help researchers develop innovative treatments for diseases like cancer. This discovery, made initially in worms, overturned previous scientific knowledge about how cells function and has significant implications for future medical advancements. The Nobel Prizes are awarded this week (see full list of [Nobel winners](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes/)). The most famous one, the Nobel Peace Prize, will be announced on Friday.

### Hurricane Milton Upgrades to a Category 5

Hurricane Milton has undergone “extreme rapid intensification,” strengthening from a tropical storm to a [Category 5 hurricane](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/hurricane-milton-live-updates-rcna174253) in just over 36 hours, with its wind speeds increasing by 90 mph in 25 hours. This phenomenon is driven by climate change, as warmer oceans and higher atmospheric moisture levels fuel stronger storms.

Milton is set to land along Florida’s Gulf Coast, where dangerously high storm surges and widespread flooding are expected. The projected point is around the Tampa area, and many areas around it have mandatory evacuation orders. Climate change is increasing the frequency of rapid storm intensifications, as seen in past hurricanes like Ida and Harvey. The last month has been an active one for hurricanes. [Hurricanes John and Helen](https://reliefweb.int/report/mexico/mexico-hurricanes-john-helene-flash-update-no-01-26-september-2024) caused a lot of destruction in Mexico and the United States.

### Pope Names 21 New Cardinals

![Pope Names 21 New Cardinals](/images/pope-names-21-new-cardinals-kyOT.webp)

Pope Francis has been continuing to shape the future of the Catholic Church by naming [21 new cardinals](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26572/pope-names-21-new-cardinals-increasing-pool-who-will-one-day-elect-his-successor), expanding the influence of his appointees in the College of Cardinals. These new cardinals include leaders from significant dioceses across Latin America, reflecting Francis’s emphasis on a global and diverse church.

While Pope Francis is the first non-European Pope since the 8th century, Catholicism has rapidly declined in Europe while maintaining a steady membership in other parts of the world, particularly Latin America. The new cardinals will officially receive their titles at a consistory on December 8, a [significant date](https://www.marywood.edu/about/history/chronological/1854-solemnity-of-the-immaculate-conception/#:~:text=On%20December%208%2C%20we%20honor,celebrating%20Mary's%20conception%20without%20sin.) in the Catholic calendar. Pope Francis has appointed most of the cardinal electors, further solidifying his influence on the next papal election.

### US Citizens Sentenced to Nearly Seven Years in Russia

A Russian court [sentenced 72-year-old American](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/07/europe/russian-court-sentences-us-citizen-stephen-hubbard-intl/index.html) Stephen James Hubbard to nearly seven years in prison for allegedly serving as a mercenary for Ukraine. Investigators claim he joined a Ukrainian defense unit in 2022, receiving $1,000 monthly. However, his family disputes this, stating that Hubbard held pro-Russian views and was unlikely to take up arms due to his age. The U.S. State Department has requested consular access to Hubbard, who is one of several Americans currently imprisoned in Russia, with plans to appeal the verdict.

A Russian court also sentenced another American citizen, Robert Gilman, to seven years and one month in a maximum-security penal colony for [assaulting a prison official](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-court-sentences-us-citizen-gilman-7-years-prison-assault-charg-rcna174230) and state investigator. Gilman was already serving time for a previous assault on a police officer in 2022, where his initial sentence of over four years was later reduced to 3.5 years.
