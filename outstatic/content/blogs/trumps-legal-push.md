### Trump Seeks Sentencing Delay Until Post-Election

Former President Donald Trump's attorneys have requested a postponement of his sentencing for felony charges related to falsifying business records, seeking to delay it until after the upcoming election. They argue that such a delay would prevent potential issues that could undermine the integrity of future proceedings. Trump, convicted in May on 34 counts connected to a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, had his sentencing date moved from July 11 to September 18. His legal team contends that the short time between a possible Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity and the sentencing date is insufficient for a proper appeal and criticized the Manhattan DA's office for potentially submitting a prejudicial recommendation.

Judge Juan Merchan, who has faced requests to recuse himself due to alleged conflicts of interest, including a congressional inquiry into his daughter's work for Kamala Harris' campaign, has rejected these claims. Merchan has also issued a partial gag order barring Trump from publicly criticizing court officials, which Trump has decried as voter interference. Trump's legal team argues that delaying sentencing would mitigate these issues and ensure fair proceedings.

### Secret Service Boosts Trump’s Security with Ballistic Glass

The Secret Service is implementing new security measures to protect former President Donald Trump during his outdoor campaign events, including the use of ballistic glass. This type of bulletproof glass, previously reserved for sitting presidents and vice presidents, will now be deployed around the country for Trump’s events. Although Trump does not have access to military aircraft for transport like current officeholders, agents will move the glass to event locations as needed, depending on specific security concerns.

In addition to the ballistic glass, the Secret Service is ramping up staffing, technology, and threat analysis to safeguard Trump. This includes deploying counter-snipers and countersurveillance measures. The decision to enhance security follows a July 13 incident in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a gunman shot at Trump during a rally, resulting in injuries and fatalities. The shooting, which led to the resignation of former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, has prompted a significant increase in protective measures for Trump’s campaign events.

### Violent Clashes Erupt in Dhaka After Hasina's Ouster

On Thursday in Dhaka, Bangladesh, student protesters and activists clashed with supporters of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, preventing them from reaching the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum on the anniversary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's assassination. The protesters, wielding bamboo sticks and iron rods, attacked Hasina’s supporters and set fire to the museum, which had been a focal point for commemorations.

Hasina, now in self-exile in India, had urged her supporters to honor Rahman, but the interim government under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus canceled the public holiday for the event. Protests also involved harassment of journalists and disruptions to media coverage, as demonstrators expressed their demands for Hasina’s trial amid ongoing unrest.

### Paetongtarn Shinawatra Becomes Thailand’s Youngest Prime Minister

Paetongtarn Shinawatra, 37, has been elected Thailand’s youngest prime minister, securing 51% of parliamentary votes amid ongoing elite power struggles. Her ascension comes just days after Srettha Thavisin’s dismissal by the judiciary, highlighting the turbulent political landscape.

As the daughter of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarn faces significant challenges, including a faltering economy and dwindling party support. Her administration must address a major cash handout program that remains unfulfilled.

The Shinawatra family, which has struggled since their first election defeat in over 20 years, now faces intense scrutiny. Paetongtarn’s appointment follows the recent dissolution of the Move Forward Party and reflects the fractured state of Thai politics.

The decision to elevate Paetongtarn has surprised analysts, who anticipated that Thaksin would delay introducing his daughter to such a volatile environment. The move places her at the center of the ongoing conflict that has previously led to the downfall of other Shinawatra leaders.

### Ukraine Advances into Kursk: A Strategic Gamble

Ukraine’s recent advance into Russia’s Kursk region has resulted in the capture of several settlements, raising questions about how long Kyiv can maintain control without risking its eastern territories. The situation is tense, with Pokrovsk urging civilians to evacuate as Russian forces close in, echoing the large-scale evacuations in Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions.

Ukrainian officials, including presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, emphasize that the goal is not occupation but disruption of Russian military operations and weakening of their infrastructure. Podolyak assured that humanitarian needs in captured areas would be met and dismissed fears of seizing the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant.

Russia acknowledges the offensive, which aims to destabilize and stretch Russian forces. Despite fears of nuclear escalation, U.S. officials have noted President Putin's lack of new threats. Ukraine plans to use the incursion to negotiate from a position of strength but insists it will only engage in talks on its terms.

This move is also seen as a strategic diversion, aimed at easing pressure on eastern fronts where Russian troops are advancing. Analysts suggest this could force Russia to reallocate resources, potentially relieving some pressure on Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk region.

### Chili’s Sales Jump 15% Thanks to Viral Appetizer

Chili’s reported a nearly 15% increase in same-store sales last quarter, driven by successful promotions like the $10.99 Big Smasher meal and the viral Triple Dipper appetizer. The chain's growth, fueled by targeted ads and social media trends, highlights a turnaround under CEO Kevin Hochman, despite a recent dip in Brinker International’s stock due to weaker earnings and a cautious forecast.

Shares of Brinker have risen 53% this year but fell 10.7% after earnings fell short of expectations. The stock rebounded 7% after being upgraded by analysts who deemed the initial reaction an overreaction. Chili’s is outperforming many rivals in the casual dining sector, with significant growth driven by high-performing menu items and increased customer traffic.

### Arsenal’s Trossard Shines Team Aims for Premier League Title

At the Four Seasons Hotel in Westlake Village, Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard demonstrated his competitive spirit by dominating a pool game with impressive skill. With Arsenal set to kick off their U.S. tour, Trossard emphasized the need for consistency throughout the Premier League season, highlighting the challenge of overcoming Manchester City, who have topped the league the past two years.

Despite a near-perfect season last year, Arsenal finished second, falling just two points short of the title. Manager Mikel Arteta acknowledged that despite setting records for wins and goals, the team must improve to secure major trophies. Recent additions like Italian defender Riccardo Calafiori and the return of versatile player Jurrien Timber aim to bolster the squad’s strength.

As the Gunners prepare for their home opener against Wolves, Arteta remains focused on refining the team’s performance. With strong defensive options and a commitment to upgrading every aspect of their game, Arsenal is determined to turn their close calls into championship success.
