### Diwali lights up the world

Diwali, or Deepavali, is a [festival](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5167938/what-is-diwali) celebrated by Hindu, Sikh, and Jain communities. It honors themes of light, prosperity, and spiritual growth. In Hindu traditions, it signifies Lord Rama's return from exile and Lord Krishna's victory over the demon Narakasura. Sikhs celebrate the release of Guru Hargobind, while Jains commemorate Lord Mahavira's enlightenment. Those belonging to other religions in South Asia sometimes also celebrate it.

Celebrations typically involve lighting oil lamps, creating intricate rangoli designs, sharing [sweets](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/diwali-2024-quick-and-easy-sweets-you-can-make-at-home-644886.html), and cleaning homes. Diwali is celebrated widely across India and the South Asian diaspora, blending cultural heritage with contemporary expressions worldwide. In the [United States](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/diwali-celebrations-go-mainstream-across-the-u-s-as-south-asians-mark-the-festival-of-lights/), there are approximately 5.2 million Indian Americans, making it the second-largest immigrant community. President Biden has hosted a [Diwali celebration at the White House](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/diwali-2024-us-election-november-5-election-white-house-president-joe-biden-extends-greetings-11730169119052.html) this week.

### Halloween crackdowns in China

![Halloween in Shanghai saw strict crowd control as police cleared revelers from nightlife areas](/images/halloween--1--E5Nj.webp)

This year, Halloween festivities in Shanghai were [closely monitored](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/shanghai-puts-stop-spooky-season-rcna177545) as police cleared costumed revelers from popular nightlife areas, enforcing crowd control measures. Social media videos showed police escorting people dressed as figures, including Donald Trump, superheroes, and Buddha-inspired characters. On Saturday, discussions about a crackdown were trending on Weibo, according to Reuters. However, online censorship has effectively muted further conversation by Monday.

In contrast to [last year's](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/03/economy/china-halloween-protests-economy/index.html) lively Halloween celebrations, which marked a return to public festivities after COVID-19 restrictions, this year's approach reflects a crackdown on gatherings that authorities may view as a form of dissent. There has yet to be a ban on Halloween in China. At the same time, approved celebrations, such as those at Shanghai Disney, are permitted, and street gatherings face strict limitations, highlighting China's increasing caution regarding [Western cultural influences](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3277076/rock-n-roll-internet-are-potential-western-colour-revolution-traps-chinese-textbook).

### Lost Mayan City

Archaeologists uncovered an [ancient Maya city](https://www.dw.com/en/lost-mayan-city-discovered-by-accident-in-mexican-jungle/a-70636302) named Valeriana in Campeche, Mexico. At its peak, the city housed between 30,000 and 50,000 people. Using [lidar technology](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-lidar.html#:~:text=Definition,the%20objects%20in%20the%20scene.), researchers identified over 6,000 structures hidden beneath dense forests, including pyramids and agricultural areas. The high-density settlement ranks among the largest Maya sites after Calakmul.

This discovery highlights the region’s rich cultural history, dating back to the [Classic Period](https://www.marc.ucsb.edu/research/maya/ancient-maya-civilization/classic-period) (250-900 AD) when the Maya civilization flourished across [Mesoamerica](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/resource-library-mesoamerica/). This unique finding challenges previous beliefs about Maya civilizations and suggests their complex societal structures. Lidar has significantly expanded archaeological discoveries in dense vegetation areas, revealing many more potential sites yet to be explored.
