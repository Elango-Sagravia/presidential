**New FBI director**

Trump’s [nomination](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/30/politics/kash-patel-fbi-director-trump/index.html) of Kash Patel as FBI director has been the latest significant controversy surrounding his nominations. [Patel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/1/who-is-kash-patel-the-trump-loyalist-tapped-to-run-the-fbi) is a Trump loyalist who gained prominence as an aide to Representative Devin Nunes. He has been a vocal critic of the FBI, particularly regarding its investigations into Trump and the Russia probe. In his book, “[Government Gangsters](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Government_Gangsters/CBZrzwEACAAJ?hl=en),” Patel alleges that the FBI and the Justice Department have shown bias against Trump and the Republican Party, claiming they are part of a "deep state" that undermines democracy.

He has openly called for a "housecleaning" of the Justice Department, raising concerns about his potential to politicize the FBI. Following his nomination, Kash Patel [expressed](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/what-kash-patel-has-said-about-the-fbi/ar-AA1v4uDz?ocid=BingNewsSerp) his gratitude to Trump by claiming that “it is the honor of the lifetime and returning the FBI to its rightful mission: protecting the American people.”

**Greenland opens international airport** 

![Nuuk International Airport opens in Greenland, enhancing tourism with larger planes, nonstop flights, and economic growth](/images/greenland-opens-major-international-airport-which-could-open-tourism-IxNz.webp)

Greenland is becoming more [accessible](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/27/travel/greenland-nuuk-international-airport-new/index.html) with the opening of Nuuk International Airport on November 28. With its 2,200-meter runway, the new airport will be able to accommodate larger planes, improving connectivity and boosting tourism. Starting in June, United Airlines will offer nonstop seasonal flights from Newark, New Jersey, cutting travel time to just over four hours. The airport, which will serve as a hub for Air Greenland, is expected to add $200,000 to the local economy with each flight.

While tourism numbers are expected to rise, officials are focused on finding a balance to avoid [overwhelming](https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/greenland-is-gorgeous-and-uncrowded-now-here-come-the-americans/ar-AA1sIp4J) the region. The opening of Nuuk’s airport is just the first step, as two more airports are planned for 2026, further opening up Greenland for exploration while preserving its unique and remote charm.

**FIFA should compensate** 

A FIFA-commissioned report has concluded that FIFA is [responsible](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/30/nx-s1-5211297/soccer-qatar-world-cup-saudi-arabia-human-rights) for compensating migrant workers harmed during the construction of the 2022 World Cup venues in Qatar. The report, released on November 30, acknowledged severe human rights abuses, including worker deaths, injuries, unpaid wages, and crippling debts due to recruitment fees. While FIFA took steps to address human rights concerns, the report found that it indirectly contributed to some of the negative impacts.

The study recommends that FIFA use its $50 million [Qatar legacy fund](https://inside.fifa.com/about-fifa/official-documents/qatar-2022-legacy-fund-plan#legacy-fund-overview) to support migrant workers, but FIFA has instead allocated the fund to global development projects. [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/fifa-must-secure-binding-human-rights-safeguards-2030-and-2034-world-cup-hosts-new) and other human rights organizations are pushing for FIFA to take direct action to compensate the workers who suffered during the World Cup preparations.
