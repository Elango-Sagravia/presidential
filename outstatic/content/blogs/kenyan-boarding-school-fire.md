### Kenyan Boarding School Fire Kills 17

A fire that started in a boy’s dormitory in Central Kenya killed 17 students while subsequently injuring 14 more. [The dormitory](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/6/students-killed-and-injured-in-kenya-boarding-school-fire) hosted 156 boys from ages 9-13. Many are shocked that there are so many in the dormitory. Around a third of the students are boarders, while the rest are day students.

Students are being hospitalized all over the region. The president expressed sorrow over the devastating event and vowed to find the root cause and punish the responsible parties. Schools nationwide have been urged to check and reinforce the safety guidelines and security protocol. It still hasn’t been revealed whether this arson is a product of evil intent or negligence.

### 7-Eleven Rejects $38 Billion Offer from Circle K

The Japanese owner of convenience store [chain](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9w74dwkgno) 7-Eleven has rejected a $38b takeover bid from a Canadian rival in charge of Circle K. 7-Eleven is the world's biggest convenience store chain, with 85,000 outlets in 20 countries and territories. The owner said he wouldn’t be opposed to negotiation but wanted a better deal, and the proposal he turned down underestimated the value of 7-11.

7-11 and Circle K are notorious rivals and monopolize many convenience stores or mini-marts in Southeast Asia. This is ironic because Japanese-run companies usually buy other foreign businesses. However, those loyal to either Team Circle K and Team 7-11 can be assured that those two will not be merging anytime soon.

### UN Mission Reports War Crimes in Sudan

A UN mission has reported that [both sides](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-mission-suspects-war-crimes-sudan-calls-peacekeeping-force-2024-09-06/) of the recent civil war in Sudan are complicit in abuse. The report reveals that data from over 180 interviews indicate both the Sudanese army and the paramilitary (RSF) have raped, attacked, and tortured civilians. The UN has urged peacemakers from all world powers to intervene as soon as possible.

Both sides dismissed the accusations of this report and previous reports made by the US and human rights groups and continue to point fingers at the other side. The civil war started last spring in Khartoum. Sudanese civilians have been facing famine, displacement, and disease at alarming rates.

### Kamala Harris Campaign Outpaces Trump in Fundraising

Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign made a big splash last month. In August, it pulled in over 361 million dollars, almost [three times more](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/06/kamala-harris-august-fundraising-00177657) than Donald Trump’s measly 131 million dollars. This is the most successful grassroots campaign in US history.

This presidential campaign is unique because the official candidate was switched within 3 months of the election. There was no traditional democratic primary, as the sitting president, Joe Biden, originally planned to seek reelection with little challenge. Kamala Harris has successfully renewed Democrats' enthusiasm. While she does have a fair number of large donors, a big chunk of her donations are from lower-level donors.

### Rome Considers Limiting Access to Trevi Fountain

Italy is another place that has popped up in the news for trying to brainstorm new ways to combat their problems with over-tourism. City officials are trying to decide if they should limit access to the Trevi fountain. The idea is to make it [accessible to residents](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/05/rome-limit-access-trevi-fountain-overtourism) and have a system where visitors can donate one or two euros.

The goal is not simply to make money off it but to control the number of people visiting and potentially weed out the more disrespectful guests. Rome has implemented an instant fine system for unruly guests. There have also been crackdowns on the tourists who frolic in the fountain to recreate the famous scene from La Dolce Vita.

### Reusable Spaceplane Could Replace Rockets

A spaceplane that can carry passengers and payloads into space and back is [in the works](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/09/05/the-reusable-spaceplane-that-could-replace-rockets-and-fly-humans-to-space-and-back). This could be a significant development in Aerospace engineering, as rockets are costly and risky. Radian Aerospace, a US-based company, is preparing to test-scale a model of this space plane this year. If all goes well, they plan to try a full-size plane in 2028.

NASA had a similar plan in the past, but they had to stop over the lack of funding. While the company tends to make this a much easier way to bring space travel to humanity, they do not want to do this for tourist purposes and stick to science and research.

### Japan Develops Skin Grafts for Robots

Japanese scientists have recently developed a new method for attaching living skin to a robot's face and [making it smile](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/economy/2024/9/6/japanese-scientists-graft-living-skin-onto-smiling-robot). Previous attempts to attach human cells to a solid surface only damaged the skin in motion. Researchers hope this can lead to realistic humanoids in the future.

While this could be a promising development in this direction, the research team says it will be a while before robotic skin is close to being perfectly realistic. This issue also raises questions about the ethics of humanoids. However, scientists have said there is time to discuss and settle the ethical issues while humanoids are being developed.
