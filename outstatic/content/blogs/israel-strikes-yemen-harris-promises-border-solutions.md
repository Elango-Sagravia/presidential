### Israel Strikes Yemen

![Israel Strikes Yemen](/images/israel-kills-hezbollah-leader-nasrallah-in-airstrike-UzNj.webp)

On Sunday, Israel conducted [airstrikes](https://www.dw.com/en/israel-strikes-yemen-as-lebanon-attacks-continue/live-70354520) on Houthi targets in Yemen, in addition to strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. The strikes, which hit power plants and ports in Hodeidah, were in response to Houthi missile attacks on Israel, including an attempt to strike Ben Gurion Airport.

The Iran-backed Houthis have intensified attacks on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians since the Gaza war broke out on [October 7](https://www.csis.org/analysis/hamass-october-7-attack-visualizing-data). Despite increased Israeli retaliation, Houthi leaders have reiterated their support for Gaza and Lebanon. This signals a broader regional confrontation, as the Houthis, aligned with Iran and Hezbollah, form part of the ["Axis of Resistance,"](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-09-26/axis-of-resistance-explained-iran-israel) which seeks to oppose Israel in the Middle East and challenge US and Western dominance in the region.

### Kamala Harris Defends Border Policy

Vice President Kamala Harris made a high-profile [visit to the U.S.-Mexico border](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqoXy_sCx7k) in Arizona to defend the Biden administration’s immigration policies, which have faced sharp criticism from Republicans. Harris, tasked with addressing immigration issues early in her vice presidency, accused former President Trump of using divisive rhetoric that failed to provide real solutions to the border crisis.

In her speech, Harris emphasized "common sense" policies that balance border security with the humane treatment of immigrants. Despite her defense, recent polls show many voters trust Trump more on immigration, especially with concerns over border security and illegal immigration rising. Harris’ visit comes at a critical time for the Biden administration, as immigration remains a key issue leading up to the 2024 election.

### Austrian Far-Right Party Wins Big in Election

In Austria's recent general election on Sunday, the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) achieved a [historic victory](https://www.dw.com/en/austrias-far-right-fp%C3%B6-wins-parliamentary-vote/a-70354491), securing nearly 30% of the vote. It was expected that they would get the most votes, but not close to a third of the votes overall. The ruling conservative OVP, led by Chancellor Karl Nehammer, also performed slightly better than expected, with around 26.2%. The other parties, such as the Social Democrats and Greens, did poorly in comparison. The Social Democrat Party that rules Austria’s capital, Vienna, secured barely over 20%.

Voters surveyed identified immigration and economic concerns as the top priorities influencing their decisions. Although the FPO emerged as the leading party, analysts believe it could face difficulties forming a government without securing enough coalition partners. Nehammer has ruled out working under FPO leader Herbert Kickl, leaving room for potential coalitions with other parties.

### Nebraska Might Be a Key State

Due to its unique [electoral system](https://www.270towin.com/content/split-electoral-votes-maine-and-nebraska/#google_vignette), Nebraska has emerged as a potential tipping point in the 2024 presidential election. Unlike most states, Nebraska splits its electoral votes by district, making its second district—a swing district—a key battleground for both Democrats and Republicans. Vice-presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz have zeroed in on Nebraska to win over undecided voters.

Walz, a native of Nebraska, focuses on [appealing to rural voters](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce812qvld9do), many of whom are frustrated with rising living costs but remain wary of Trump’s legal troubles. Meanwhile, Republicans are capitalizing on Nebraska’s traditional conservative leanings, emphasizing immigration and economic policies. The second district’s vote could be critical in a tightly contested election, giving Nebraska an outsized role in 2024.

### Floods Kill Over 140 in Nepal

![Floods Kill Over 140 in Nepal](/images/floods-kill-120-in-nepal-EwOT.webp)

Nepal is facing [significant floods](https://www.yahoo.com/news/death-toll-nepal-floods-landslides-114832287.html) and landslides after two days of intense rain, resulting in at least 148 deaths and over 100 injuries. More than 50 people are still missing, and around 3,600 have been rescued from the hard-hit Kathmandu valley. Many areas in the valley remain isolated and cut off due to blocked roads, which has hindered rescue missions and led to tragic fatalities.

Nepal expects more rain through Tuesday, and the situation is very severe. Ten thousand rescue workers have been mobilized and are on the ground. These floods are a sobering reminder of how climate change intensifies storms. 2024 has been a dire year for disastrous weather, particularly this last month. Many [corners of the world](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5zx2zx5xvo) have been experiencing severe floods.
