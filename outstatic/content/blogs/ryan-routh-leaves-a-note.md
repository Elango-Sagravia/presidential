### Attempted Trump Assassin Left a Note

Prosecutors are [charging](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5l9jzjglo) Ryan Routh, who was arrested on September 15th, with attempted assassination. Court filings reveal Routh had written a note months earlier stating his intent to kill Trump, calling it an "assassination attempt." He was hiding with a rifle near the golf course's sixth hole when the Secret Service caught him and fired at him when he allegedly moved his weapon. 

After his arrest, investigators found a list of Trump’s public appearances and evidence of Routh’s extended presence near Mar-a-Lago. Routh was facing two gun charges, but this new information upgraded his charges to include the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate. This much more serious charge could put him behind bars for life.

Travis King, a U.S. Army private who crossed into North Korea in July 2023, [pleaded](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/travis-king-u-s-soldier-north-korea-pleads-guilty-desertion/) guilty to desertion and other charges in a military court at Fort Bliss, Texas. As part of a plea deal, he admitted to desertion, disobeying superior officers, and assaulting a noncommissioned officer. King was sentenced to 12 months confinement, credited for time served, demoted to the lowest enlisted rank, and dishonorably discharged.

Travis King fled to North Korea after skipping a flight back to the U.S. following time in a South Korean detention facility. After two months, North Korea expelled him to China, which returned him to U.S. custody in New Mexico. His attorney noted King has accepted responsibility and will return home soon.

![Erik Menendez criticized Netflix's Monsters for distorting their trial](/images/menendez-brothers-react-negatively-to-the-netflix-series-Y2Nz.webp)

Erik Menendez has [criticized](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123898/menendez-brothers-comment-netflix-monsters) Netflix’s *Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story*, which revisits the trials that convicted him and his brother, Lyle, of murdering their parents. Erik’s wife Tammi shared his statement on X. Erik accused co-creator Ryan Murphy of distorting facts and portraying "blatant lies" about their case. He expressed frustration that the series misrepresents their defense of years of abuse. 

The brothers’ case remains controversial, with public opinion divided on whether they acted out of abuse or greed. Recently, Roy Rosselló, a former member of the boy band Menudo, [claimed](https://www.thedailybeast.com/where-are-lyle-and-erik-menendez-now-could-new-evidence-see-them-released-from-prison) in an affidavit that he was also abused by José Menendez, supporting the brothers' abuse claims. This could set the scene for their case to be reopened.
