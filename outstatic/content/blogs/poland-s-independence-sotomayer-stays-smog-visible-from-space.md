### Poland turns 123

![Poland celebrated Independence Day as President Duda urged continued U.S. support for European security](/images/polish-independence-day-k5NT.webp)

On Monday, Poland celebrated its [Independence Day](https://www.trade.gov.pl/en/news/independence-day-polish-history-and-polands-economic-transformation/), marking the restoration of sovereignty after 123 years of partitions. This pivotal moment in the country's history signified its emergence as a sovereign state after centuries of foreign occupation, shaping Poland's national identity. Despite facing numerous challenges, including rebuilding after World War I and the devastation of World War II, Poland successfully transitioned to a free-market economy in the 1990s, leading to rapid economic growth. There are 10 million Americans of [Polish descent](https://x.com/PolishEmbassyUS/status/1123937677345206274) today.

Polish President Andrzej Duda marked Independence Day by [stressing the need](https://apnews.com/article/poland-independence-day-march-duda-6dc4217f77184dcd8f8562e6c0fac595) for continued U.S. commitment to European security in light of Russian aggression and called for the restoration of Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders. Duda warned that Europe could not ensure its security without U.S. support, criticizing the idea that Europe could manage alone amid Russia’s imperial ambitions. Duda emphasized the importance of strengthening Euro-Atlantic ties.

### Sotomayer stays on bench

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is 70 years old and has publicly managed type 1 diabetes, is [facing increasing pressure](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4n2rdjp6o) from some Democrats to retire. This allows President Joe Biden to nominate a younger replacement before Donald Trump’s anticipated return to the White House. This pressure is fueled by fears that with Trump back in office, he may have the chance to shift the court further to the right, as he did during his first term with the appointment of [Justice Amy Coney Barrett](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54700307).

However, sources close to Justice Sotomayor have vehemently denied the suggestion that she plans to step down. They emphasize that she is in excellent health, takes great care of herself, and is crucial to the court at this time. Some of her defenders, including [Bernie Sanders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/bernie-sanders-supreme-court-justices-sonia-sotomayor-biden), argue that calls for her resignation are unfair and ageist, as she remains an active and vital voice on the bench.

### Space smog

Record-breaking toxic smog has [enveloped](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/11/asia/pakistan-punjab-pollution-satellite-images-climate-intl-hnk/index.html) eastern Pakistan and northern India, causing a severe air quality crisis. Satellite imagery reveals a massive cloud of smog over Pakistan’s Punjab province and parts of India, including New Delhi. The pollution, primarily from crop burning, coal plants, and traffic, has led to hazardous air quality readings exceeding 1,000 in some areas.

Hospitals are overwhelmed, with over 30,000 people in Pakistan treated for respiratory issues. In response, authorities have [closed](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/districts-pakistan-close-parks-zoo-schools-residents-choke-115634446) schools, parks, and outdoor spaces. Children, the elderly, and vulnerable populations are at high risk. Climate change is worsening pollution, necessitating urgent regional cooperation, with calls for long-term solutions to protect public health and address this recurring crisis [(see our write-up)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/global-eyes-on-the-u-s-israel-in-suez-pakistan-s-climate-action).
