### Instagram Fails to Remove 93% of Abusive Comments

A recent report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate reveals that Instagram failed to remove 93% of abusive comments directed at female politicians. The nonprofit flagged 1,000 comments on the accounts of 10 women, including both Republicans and Democrats and found that the majority of these comments, many of which were sexually degrading or included violent threats, remained online a week later.

Instagram's response has been to review the flagged content and continue improving its enforcement tools, though it has acknowledged that not all offensive comments necessarily violate its rules. The report highlights the challenge faced by female politicians, like Vice President Kamala Harris, who also faced high levels of abuse. The persistence of such harassment underscores the need for more effective moderation and transparency on the platform.

### Tip Tax Debate in 2024 Election Heats Up

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both advocating for removing taxes on tip income, but their approaches diverge on minimum wage policy. Harris has proposed eliminating federal tip taxes while also raising the national minimum wage, which has stagnated at $7.25 an hour since 2009. In contrast, Trump’s plan focuses solely on tip income without addressing base pay, a point of contention among workers and advocates.

The push to eliminate tip taxes has gained bipartisan traction but faces criticism for potentially incentivizing employers to rely more on tipped workers. Critics, including Saru Jayaraman of One Fair Wage, argue that such proposals are inadequate without addressing the low subminimum wage for tipped workers, which remains at $2.13 an hour. Recent increases in state minimum wages and efforts to phase out subminimum pay highlight a growing movement for fairer wages, with both Democratic and Republican leaders grappling with how to balance these changes.

### Spicy Ramen Noodles Return to Danish Shelves

In central Copenhagen, Danes celebrated the return of Samyang Foods’ Buldak ramen noodles, which had been banned in June due to their extreme spiciness. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration had previously removed the noodles over health concerns related to high capsaicin levels.

The ban was lifted for two ramen variants last month after further testing showed they were within safe limits. Samyang marked the occasion by hosting an event for social media influencers on a brightly decorated ferry in Copenhagen.

The return of the noodles is especially welcomed by fans like Phillip, who stockpiled the banned products and is excited to see them back on shelves.

### India Launches App to Prevent Elephant Conflicts

In India, the state of Assam has introduced a mobile app, HaatiApp, to warn residents of approaching wild elephant herds and reduce conflicts between humans and elephants. Developed by the conservation group Aaranyak, the app tracks elephant movements and provides alerts to prevent dangerous encounters.

Human-elephant clashes have risen due to habitat loss caused by urban expansion, resulting in over 200 elephant deaths and 400 human fatalities from 2017 to 2022 in Assam. The app also allows users to report sightings and damages and seek compensation. Alongside the app, Aaranyak released a handbook on using solar-powered fences to protect property from elephants.

### Taliban Marks Three Years with Military Display

On August 14, the Taliban celebrated the third anniversary of their return to power at the former Bagram Air Base, focusing on their achievements in enforcing Islamic law and bolstering military capabilities. The event, attended by around 10,000 men, including senior Taliban officials, featured a display of U.S. military equipment left behind after the NATO withdrawal.

No discussion was made about Afghanistan's severe economic and humanitarian crises, which have left millions on the brink of starvation and high unemployment. The Taliban’s celebration was marked by a call for international engagement, though the regime remains unrecognized globally, and the dire conditions for Afghan women and girls were largely overlooked.

### Mars to Acquire Kellanova for $35.9 Billion

Mars has announced its plan to acquire Kellanova, the Kellogg spin-off, for $35.9 billion in cash, valuing the company at $83.50 per share. This deal will integrate popular Kellanova brands like Pringles and Cheez-Its into Mars’ snacking division, enhancing its market presence.

The acquisition aligns with Mars' strategy to expand its global snacking business, leveraging Kellanova's $13 billion in annual sales and its portfolio of brands, including RXBAR and Nutri-Grain. The transaction, set to close in early 2025, reflects growing consumer demand for well-known snack brands amid economic pressures and shifting grocery trends.

### SpaceX Cited for Environmental Violations

SpaceX has been cited by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the EPA for repeatedly discharging pollutants into nearby water bodies from its Starbase launch facility. The company is accused of operating an unpermitted water deluge system, which has led to complaints and violations of the Clean Water Act.

The controversy surrounds SpaceX’s use of this system, which was installed to mitigate launch-related explosions but has not been approved by regulators. The issues include high mercury levels and failure to meet discharge limits, which could lead to further legal and operational setbacks.

Despite the violations, SpaceX asserts that its operations are environmentally safe and continues to work on necessary permits. The FAA has also postponed public meetings related to SpaceX’s launch plans, though reasons for this delay have not been specified.

### Dearica Hamby Sues Las Vegas Aces

WNBA star Dearica Hamby has filed a federal lawsuit against her former team, the Las Vegas Aces, claiming discrimination and retaliation after she disclosed her pregnancy. Hamby, who recently joined the Los Angeles Sparks, alleges that the team mistreated her following her pregnancy announcement and failed to honor contract promises, such as paying for her daughter’s school tuition and providing housing.

The lawsuit also names the WNBA for not adequately addressing her complaints. Hamby claims that after publicly announcing her pregnancy, team staff, including head coach Becky Hammon, questioned her commitment and wrongfully terminated her contract. The league had previously investigated and found the Aces violating rules, resulting in penalties for the team and Hammon.
