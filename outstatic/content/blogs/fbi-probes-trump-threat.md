### FBI Investigates Assassination Attempt on Donald Trump

The FBI is currently investigating what appears to be an assassination attempt on former president and presidential nominee Donald Trump. The incident happened at his golf club in Florida. The Secret Service spotted the suspect, who was in the bushes nearby. Once spotted, the suspect fled to his car. After a chase on the highway, they pulled the suspect out.

The suspect’s name is [Ryan Weasly Routh](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/trump-attempted-assassination-man-detained/index.html). His family and friends know him as an idealist. In the last couple of years, he’s been very active in advocating for Ukraine. He owns a small construction company in Hawaii. This event happens just two months after the [last attempt on his life](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/14/us/5-things-july-14-trnd/index.html) at a rally in Pennsylvania.

French authorities have reported that at least eight migrants have died while trying to reach the UK by crossing the channel from France. The tragedy happened just right off the beach from Ambleteuse in Northern France. First Aid was given to 53 people, and eight still perished, mainly from hypothermia. The survivors are from Eritrea, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Iran.

A tragedy similar to this happened just [several weeks ago](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/3/at-least-12-people-killed-after-boat-capsizes-in-english-channel), with the number of deaths in the Channel rising this year. France and the UK are expected to make some agreement on migration and figure out a solution that combats the gangs behind the small boat arrivals that keep putting migrants on faulty boats that keep sinking.

### Mexico's New Law: All Judges to be Elected

![Mexico's new law requires judges to be elected by popular vote](/images/all-judges-in-mexico-will-be-elected-in-the-future-M1MT.webp)

Mexico has passed a controversial judicial reform requiring that all judges, including Supreme Court justices, be elected by popular vote. Signed into law by the outgoing president, the reform has sparked [protests](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4y9q74j2ko), with critics arguing it undermines the system of checks and balances. Many fear judges will prioritize populism over the legal framework, making them more vulnerable to political influence.

Supporters of the law claim it will make the judiciary more accountable to the Mexican people and ensure that judges reflect public sentiment. The outgoing president, who has had several disputes with the Supreme Court, pushed for the reform before leaving office at the end of the month. Protests against the law continue in parts of the country.

### Jordan’s King Appoints Harvard-Educated Technocrat as New PM

After the government resigned on Sunday, Jordan’s King Abdullah appointed key palace aide Jafar Hassan as [prime minister](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/jordans-pm-khasawneh-submits-resignation-days-after-parliamentary-polls-sources-2024-09-15/). Hassan, a former planning minister educated at Harvard University, will face the challenge of mitigating the impact of the Gaza war on Jordan’s economy. The outgoing prime minister attempted to make reforms to reverse Jordan's slow growth, which has worsened due to the pandemic and conflict in neighboring Iraq and Syria.

Though the king holds most of the power, parliament retains the ability to pass a vote of no confidence. While Islamist parties saw some electoral gains, the parliament remains largely pro-government.
