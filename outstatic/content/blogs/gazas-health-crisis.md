### Health Crisis in Gaza as Polluted Water Devastates Children’s Health

Since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war, many children have been suffering from waterborne illnesses such as hepatitis and skin infections. The conflict has wreaked havoc on Gaza’s water infrastructure, with Oxfam International reporting that 94% of water availability has been lost due to damage to desalination plants and wells.

Almost all of Gaza’s wastewater treatment plants have been destroyed, leaving the water supply dangerously contaminated. Humanitarian efforts to repair infrastructure and provide clean water are facing significant obstacles.

Health issues are on the rise, including a notable increase in hepatitis A cases, respiratory infections, and skin diseases. Additionally, traces of the polio virus have been detected in wastewater, raising concerns about a potential outbreak. The UN is working to restore a desalination plant and distribute vaccines, but logistical challenges continue to hinder these crucial efforts.

### Philippine Military Denounces China’s Actions in South China Sea

The Philippine military has condemned China for its "dangerous and provocative actions" in the South China Sea following a recent incident at Scarborough Shoal. On Thursday, two People's Liberation Army Air Force jets performed a risky maneuver and dropped flares near a Philippine NC-212i aircraft that was conducting a routine patrol.

This incident marks the first formal complaint about Chinese aircraft under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has been in office since 2022. The Philippines' Armed Forces Chief, Romeo Brawner, criticized the actions as hazardous to Philippine personnel and a violation of international aviation safety laws.

China’s embassy in Manila has yet to respond to these remarks. Scarborough Shoal, a disputed area seized by China in 2012, remains a frequent spot for Filipino fishermen. Tensions in the South China Sea continue, with ongoing disputes between several nations and China rejecting a 2016 international court ruling that challenged its claims.

### Mass Protests in Belgrade Against Lithium Mining

Tens of thousands of people protested in Belgrade on Saturday against plans for lithium mining in Serbia, despite President Aleksandar Vučić's claims that foreign powers are orchestrating a coup. The demonstrators, who chanted slogans such as “There will be no mining” and “Treason, treason,” are demanding an official ban on lithium extraction.

The rally was one of the largest in recent years, with protesters marching towards railway stations to block train traffic. The Serbian government has labeled the protests as politically motivated, drawing comparisons to Ukraine’s Maidan uprising. This backlash comes as the government moves forward with the planned mining, which had been paused in 2022 but is now part of Serbia's deal with the EU to secure critical raw materials.

The mining project, led by Rio Tinto, has reignited concerns over environmental damage and potential threats to local water reserves. In response, the government has established health monitoring systems and a call center to address public concerns.
