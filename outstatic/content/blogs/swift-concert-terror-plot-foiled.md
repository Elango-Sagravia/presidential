### Three Arrested in Foiled Terror Plot at Swift Concerts

A third teenager has been arrested in connection with a thwarted attack on Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna, Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner announced. The 18-year-old, who is alleged to have been in contact with the primary suspect, was taken into custody as part of a plot inspired by Islamic extremist groups.

Authorities discovered bomb-making materials at one suspect's home and reported that one of the suspects had confessed to planning mass casualties outside the concert venue. This plot led to the cancellation of three sold-out concerts, disrupting plans for thousands of fans.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer supported the cancellation, prioritizing safety over fan disappointment. The main suspect, a 19-year-old who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and a 17-year-old employed at the concert venue, had recently shown signs of radicalization. The attack was planned for either Thursday or Friday.

The U.S. State Department and Austrian intelligence services were involved in the investigation, though the specific roles of U.S. intelligence remain undisclosed. In response to the cancellations, the concert promoter has refunded tickets and train fares.

### Muhammad Yunus Takes Charge as Bangladesh Leader

On Thursday, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus assumed leadership of Bangladesh’s caretaker government amid severe unrest that had forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India. Yunus, renowned for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering microcredit, is tasked with stabilizing the nation and overseeing fresh parliamentary elections.

In his inaugural address, Yunus promised a return to democracy and human rights, strongly condemning the "brutal, autocratic regime" of Hasina. His appointment comes after a period of violent protests and attacks, including the vandalism of Hindu properties and clashes that resulted in numerous casualties. The new caretaker government does not include Hasina’s Awami League, which has been in power for 20 of the last 30 years.

The main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is demanding new elections within three months. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Yunus and expressed hope for restored normalcy and protection for minority communities. Yunus's leadership is seen as a critical step towards resolving the country’s ongoing crisis.

### Stellantis Plans Major Layoffs at Warren Truck Plant

Stellantis is planning to lay off up to 2,450 of its 3,700 workers at the Warren Truck Plant near Detroit. This potential reduction affects employees who build the older Ram 1500 Tradesman, as production shifts to a newer model at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant. The layoffs could begin as soon as October 8. Stellantis, which has seen a steep 48% drop in net profits for the first half of the year, has promised 52 weeks of unemployment benefits, transition assistance, and two years of healthcare for the affected workers.

The decision follows CEO Carlos Tavares’ commitment to address financial challenges and improve performance. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain criticized Stellantis for not providing adequate support to its workforce, despite significant investments from taxpayers, workers, and consumers.

Canadian Philip Kim, known as B-Boy Phil Wizard, captivated audiences and secured the first Olympic gold medal for men's breaking. Kim's electrifying performance, highlighted by his dynamic moves and boundless energy, earned him a decisive 3-0 victory over France's Danis Civil. Even after the win was announced, Kim continued to showcase his skills, demonstrating his stamina and enthusiasm despite a long day of intense competition at Place de la Concorde. Reflecting on his success, Kim admitted to feeling nervous but was thrilled to have delivered and enjoyed the historic moment alongside his fellow competitors.

Frenchman Danis Civil, who won the silver medal, performed admirably in front of a supportive home crowd, narrowly edging out Victor Montalvo from the U.S. in the semifinals. Montalvo, known as B-Boy Victor, claimed bronze after a hard-fought battle with Japan's B-Boy Shigekix. Montalvo expressed pride in bringing a medal back to the U.S., the birthplace of breaking, and noted the unity among competitors on the Olympic stage.

Although breaking is not on the program for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, Kim hoped that its Olympic debut would inspire and elevate the sport, emphasizing its significance and potential.

### Lin Yu-ting Wins Women’s Boxing Gold Amid Controversy

Lin Yu-ting claimed the women’s featherweight boxing title with a decisive win over Poland’s Julia Szeremeta on Saturday. Her victory is notable amid a high-profile gender dispute involving her and Algeria’s Imane Khelif, which has sparked significant social media discussion and led to a legal complaint from Khelif.

At 28, Lin made history as Taiwan’s first gold medallist in boxing. Taiwan had previously earned only three bronze medals in the sport, with two at the Paris Olympics. Lin expressed her gratitude and emphasized that every match, despite the 5-0 win, tests her rigorous training.

Lin and Khelif had faced disqualification from the 2023 World Championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA) due to gender testing issues. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which now oversees boxing for the Paris Games, dismissed these tests as arbitrary and is using eligibility rules from previous Olympics that do not include gender testing.

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te praised Lin for her performance and the support from Taiwan despite the controversy. In her bout, Lin effectively used her jab and landed several right hooks, while Szeremeta struggled with speed and accuracy. Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines and Turkey’s Esra Yildiz won bronze medals.
