### US Shields Israel

The U.S. is deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense [(THAAD) ](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12645/2)system and its crew to Israel to enhance its defense capabilities after a recent missile attack from Iran [(see our write-up)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/israel-launches-ground-offensive-rutte-takes-nato-helm-iran-escalates) on October 1. This deployment underscores [U.S. support for Israel](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39le0dp4p7o) amidst escalating tensions with Iran. Iran’s missile barrage was said to be in retaliation for Israel’s assassination of key Hezbollah, IRGC, and Hamas figures.

THAAD protects against ballistic missile threats, complementing Israel’s existing [missile defense layers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20385306) like the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and the Arrow systems. The decision to send the system and crew follows heightened regional instability and repeated cross-border hostilities, especially between Israel and Hezbollah, which has been firing into Israel from Lebanon since October 2023. Despite international efforts, there has been no ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, contributing to ongoing regional conflict.

### Gunman at Trump Rally

![: A 49-year-old man was arrested outside Donald Trump's Coachella rally](/images/man-with-loaded-gun-arrested-at-checkpoint-near-donald-trump-s-weekend-rally-in-southern-california-c3Mz.webp)

A 49-year-old man from Las Vegas was [arrested at a security checkpoint](https://apnews.com/article/trump-rally-arrest-coachella-california-282a384e3fae256352c685174a3a74f4) outside Donald Trump’s rally in Coachella, California, on Saturday. He was found with a shotgun, a loaded handgun, ammunition, and several fake passports in his unregistered SUV, which had a homemade license plate. Despite claiming to be a journalist, it was unclear if he had proper credentials. The man was arrested on charges of possessing a loaded firearm and a high-capacity magazine but was released the same day on $5,000 bail.

Security at Trump rallies has been especially tight following two recent assassination attempts. Last month, a man was indicted for [staking out Trump for 12 hours](https://apnews.com/article/trump-assassination-attempt-florida-fbi-justice-department-1295144a65f46059ce39b4ccd7288fbc), writing about his desire to kill him. Just two months earlier, Trump was [shot and wounded in the ear](https://apnews.com/article/trump-vp-vance-rubio-7c7ba6b99b5f38d2d840ed95b2fdc3e5) during an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Despite these incidents, Trump’s rally schedule remains aggressive ahead of the 2024 election.

### Buried Secrets

Archaeologists have made a remarkable discovery beneath the Khaznah (Treasury) in Petra, Jordan. They have unearthed a tomb containing at least 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back over 2,000 years [(see photos)](https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/science/hugely-rare-discovery-at-indiana-jones-filming-site-2000-year-old-tomb-with-12-skeletons-and-holy-grail-chalice/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Among the well-preserved artifacts is a ceramic vessel resembling the Holy Grail, found clutched by one of the skeletons.

This significant discovery provides rare insights into the [Nabataean](https://www.worldhistory.org/Kingdom_of_Nabatea/) society that built Petra. The tomb is located beneath the iconic Treasury, which was featured in the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. While the artifacts are exceptionally well-preserved, the human remains show signs of deterioration, likely due to the humid environment within the tomb.

### Biden’s Half-Billion-Dollar Boost

President Joe Biden visited St. Pete Beach to announce [$612 million in recovery funding](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/biden-expected-to-announce-more-than-600-million-in-milton-recovery-support-sunday-in-tampa/) following hurricanes Milton and Helene to strengthen Florida’s electric grids and reduce future power outages. The funds, distributed through the U.S. Department of Energy, include $47 million each for Florida Power & Light and Gainesville Regional Utilities. During his visit, Biden empathized with residents and business owners affected by the storms, sharing his experience with loss.

He emphasized a coordinated federal response involving various agencies, including FEMA, which has provided critical resources such as meals and water. On Monday morning, nearly 460,000 Floridians remained [without power](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/14/florida-power-outage-map-milton/75668580007/) following Hurricane Milton’s devastating impact, particularly along the west-central coast [(see the aftermath)](https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/hurricanes/live-blog/hurricane-milton-aftermath-live-updates-rcna174988). The storm caused significant destruction, including tearing the roof off Tropicana Field and resulting in at least 17 fatalities.
