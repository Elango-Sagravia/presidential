### Instagram Introduces Teen Accounts with Restricted Features

Instagram is implementing a change in how it deals with underage accounts. The platform will automatically set [stricter privacy settings](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/g-s1-23181/instagram-teen-accounts-private-meta-child-safety) for users under 16, including parental permission required to change certain settings. While the system relies on users being honest about their age, Instagram has age verification tools for suspected misuse.

With growing concerns over teen social media use, these changes aim to increase safety. However, Instagram’s popularity among younger users has been declining, with many teens now gravitating towards TikTok. Despite TikTok's dominance, it faces a potential [ban in the U.S](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53476117).

### Diddy Denied Bail, Remains in Custody

On Tuesday, Sean “Diddy” Combs was [denied bail](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3x50jy15o) and taken into custody in Brooklyn. Due to his high-profile status, he was put in special housing, separate from the general population. His lawyers were trying to get him under house arrest with a 50 million dollar bond secured by his Miami residence.

Combs is facing numerous charges related to sex trafficking and racketeering. He is maintaining his innocence and pleading not guilty to the charges. Despite another opportunity to appeal for bail on Wednesday, the judge maintained that no conditions could ensure community safety, citing concerns about potential contact with those involved in the case.

### U.S. Drug Overdose Deaths Drop

U.S. deaths from drug overdoses have [decreased](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm) for the first time in years. New reports have surfaced that between April 2023 and April 2024, drug-related deaths dropped by roughly 10%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trends in the years before showed rates rising by percentages in the double digits.

The decline is largely attributed to better access to overdose-reversing treatments like naloxone and the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had worsened addiction-related issues. Researchers are still awaiting state-by-state data, but initial reports suggest some states may have seen reductions of up to 20%. Despite this progress, experts caution that more needs to be done to address the root causes of addiction.

A 30-year-old German tourist died from a shark attack while sailing near Spain’s Canary Islands. The woman was bitten and lost her leg, later suffering a heart attack during transport to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Moroccan rescue services initially responded but lacked adequate resources, so Spanish authorities eventually took over the operation.

Shark attacks in the region are rare, with only six fatalities over the last 500 years. Globally, [shark-related deaths](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/yearly-worldwide-summary/) are infrequent, with around a dozen fatalities per year. Despite their fearsome reputation, the risk of dying from a shark attack remains extremely low compared to other wildlife encounters.

### Exploding Pagers Trace to Hungary and Taiwan

On Wednesday, Hungary [denied](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-exploding-pages-never-country-hezbollah-viktor-orban/) any involvement in the exploding pagers used in recent attacks in Lebanon and Syria, despite initial reports suggesting a connection. The pagers, labeled under the Taiwanese brand Gold Apollo, were believed to have been manufactured in Hungary. However, the Taiwanese company clarified that its name had been licensed to a firm in Budapest, which does not operate within Hungary.

The [incident](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04m913m49o) has raised questions about why Hezbollah forces are still using pagers in 2024. Experts suggest that pagers offer a way to avoid detection by modern tracking technology, which may explain their continued use in conflict zones. Hungary has firmly stated it has no ties to the devices.
