Venezuelan opposition figures Maria Corina Machado and Edmundo González Urrutia were awarded the European Parliament’s [Sakharov Prize](https://www.dw.com/en/venezuelan-pro-democracy-figures-win-eus-sakharov-prize/a-70585458) for their dedication to human rights and democracy in Venezuela. The parliament recognized them for representing all the Venezuelans striving for freedom against [Nicolás Maduro’s regime](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolas-Maduro). Machado, a leading pro-democracy figure, is currently [in hiding](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/3272862/venezuela-opposition-leader-machado-says-she-hiding-fearing-my-life), while González [fled to Spain](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/venezuelan-opposition-candidate-gonzalez-flees-country-for-political-asylum-in-spain) after facing an arrest warrant. The award highlights their courageous efforts for a democratic future in Venezuela. 

The European Parliament awards the [Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/sakharovprize/en/home) each year to individuals or organizations dedicated to defending human rights and fundamental freedoms. Established in 1988, it was first awarded to Nelson Mandela. It honors the legacy of Soviet dissident [Andrei Sakharov](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/sakharovprize/en/the-prize/andrei-sakharov), who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.

### “Lonely Deaths” in Seoul

![South Korea invests $327 million to combat "lonely death" and social isolation](/images/a-loneliness-epidemic-is-spreading-worldwide-gzOD.webp)

Every year, thousands of South Koreans die alone due to social isolation, leading to what is termed “lonely death.” The Seoul government plans to remedy this by announcing a [significant investment](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/24/asia/south-korea-loneliness-deaths-intl-hnk/index.html) of nearly $327 million over the next five years to combat loneliness. Initiatives will include 24/7 counseling, in-person support, and programs to increase social interactions. Experts emphasize the need for more profound cultural shifts to effectively address the issue, highlighting how South Korean societal norms contribute to [feelings of inadequacy and isolation](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/11/1229437757/social-isolation-south-korea).

South Korea faces a demographic crisis with an aging population and meager birth rates. As of 2023, South Korea had the [second-highest life expectancy](https://www.statista.com/topics/12258/aging-population-in-south-korea/#:~:text=South%20Korea's%20population%20is%20aging,intensify%20in%20the%20coming%20years.) globally, but it also reported the world’s lowest fertility rate at just 0.72 births per woman. This combination of an aging society and declining birth rates raises concerns about the future workforce and economic sustainability, prompting the government to explore policies to address these challenges.

### DOJ Warns Musk

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has expressed [concerns](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c748l0zv4x8o) regarding Elon Musk’s political action committee, America PAC, about the legality of his recent [$1 million daily](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/elon-musk-promises-to-award-1m-every-day-to-voters-as-he-steps-up-campaigning-for-trump) giveaway to registered voters. This initiative, announced at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, seeks to encourage participation in a petition supporting constitutional amendments related to the [First and Second Amendments](https://www.pbs.org/tpt/constitution-usa-peter-sagal/rights/first-and-second-amendments/).

The DOJ’s warning comes amid rising criticism, particularly from Democrats, who argue that such a giveaway may violate federal election laws prohibiting payments for voter registration. While Musk maintains that the giveaway is lawful, stating participants don’t need to belong to any political party, legal experts have voiced skepticism [(see previous issue)](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/berlin-attack-foiled-cuba-blackout-musk-s-million-dollar-move). Many believe the contest could be interpreted as a payment for voter registration, which is explicitly illegal under U.S. law.
