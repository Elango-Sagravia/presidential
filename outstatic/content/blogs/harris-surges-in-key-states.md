### Harris Surges in Key States as Trump Reconnects with Musk

Recent polls from The New York Times and Siena College show Vice President Kamala Harris leading in crucial battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, though her lead is within the margin of error. Notably, Harris’s popularity has surged compared to President Joe Biden’s approval ratings before his campaign ended. In Pennsylvania, Harris has flipped a -13 net rating to a +2 net rating over the past month, a dramatic 22-point swing from Biden’s ratings. This shift suggests a potential reset in the 2024 race, though it remains to be seen if this boost is lasting or merely a temporary uplift following Biden’s exit.

Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is set for a virtual discussion with Elon Musk on X, highlighting their fluctuating relationship. Musk, who reinstated Trump’s account in November 2022, has recently fully endorsed Trump and created a super PAC to support him. Despite earlier tensions, including Musk’s criticism of Trump and his endorsement of Ron DeSantis, their relationship has warmed. Trump is now actively engaging on X as he prepares for this evening’s event with Musk.

### Harris Taps Nasrina Bargzie for Muslim and Arab Voter Outreach

Vice President Kamala Harris is expanding her campaign’s focus on Muslim and Arab voters by hiring Nasrina Bargzie to lead outreach efforts. Bargzie, who previously worked as a policy adviser in Harris’s White House office, will address the concerns of these communities, particularly in light of their discontent with President Joe Biden’s support of Israel. Her role will encompass a wide range of issues, including democracy, reproductive rights, and Middle East policy.

Bargzie, a former refugee from Afghanistan, is expected to play a crucial role as Harris seeks to differentiate her stance on Middle Eastern issues from Biden’s. While Harris has faced protests from pro-Palestinian activists and criticism for her responses to these demonstrations, some Muslim leaders have expressed support, noting her empathy towards Gaza and commitment to peace. The Black Muslim Leadership Council Fund, a significant group previously uncommitted, has endorsed Harris, citing her more sympathetic approach compared to Biden and former President Donald Trump.

Arshad Nadeem, a javelin thrower from Pakistan, has been warmly celebrated after winning the country’s first individual gold medal at the Paris Olympics. The 27-year-old was greeted by thousands at the airport and honored with a grand welcome in his hometown of Mian Channu, including a water cannon salute and garlands.

Nadeem, who previously trained with homemade javelins, beat defending champion Neeraj Chopra with a throw of 92.97 meters, setting a new Olympic record. This victory, Pakistan’s first gold since 1984, has brought him national acclaim and spotlighted the challenges he faced due to a lack of resources and support.

Despite limited facilities and financial backing, Nadeem’s dedication and resilience have been praised. His success has also highlighted the sportsmanship between him and Chopra, with both athletes showing mutual respect and demonstrating the positive side of their rivalry.

### Yukon Mom Survives Grizzly Bear Attack, Credits Daughter for Survival

Vanessa Chaput, 24, from Yukon, Canada, survived a harrowing grizzly bear attack while jogging on June 30. Chaput was confronted by three bears and fought off a male bear that mauled her, resulting in significant injuries but no life-threatening damage, thanks to her strong survival instincts and a sudden intervention from her dog, Luna.

Chaput, who used her Apple Watch to call for help, was hospitalized for 10 days with over 30 stitches, a broken arm, and various other injuries. She credits her daughter and Luna for her survival, as Luna’s barking helped scare the bear away.

The attack prompted the euthanization of several bears in the area, and officials are investigating the incident further. Despite her traumatic experience, Chaput expressed gratitude for her survival and plans to take time to recover before returning to the trails.

### Starbucks Appoints Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol Amid Sales Struggles

Starbucks is replacing CEO Laxman Narasimhan with Brian Niccol, the current head of Chipotle, starting next month. The move aims to address declining sales and investor dissatisfaction. Narasimhan, who took over in March 2023, is leaving the company as Starbucks faces weak performance in the U.S. and China, coupled with customer complaints about service and prices.

Niccol, credited with transforming Chipotle and significantly boosting its stock, is expected to bring similar success to Starbucks. His track record at Chipotle, where he led the company through strong growth, contrasts with Starbucks' recent struggles, which saw its stock drop nearly 20% this year.

Chipotle COO Scott Boatwright will serve as interim CEO during the transition, while Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri will act as interim chief until Niccol officially begins. The leadership change reflects Starbucks' efforts to revitalize its brand and operational performance.
