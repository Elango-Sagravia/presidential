### SpaceX Nails Starship Test

On Sunday, SpaceX successfully executed its most daring Starship test flight yet. The almost 400-foot-tall Starship launched from Texas, and, for the first time, SpaceX managed to [catch its returning booster](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/13/science/spacex-starship-test-flight-5-launch/index.html) with mechanical arms attached to the launch tower, a maneuver that left even CEO Elon Musk astonished [(watch video)](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/spacex-rocket-booster-makes-successful-113300543.html).This recovery marks a significant leap toward fully reusable rockets, a goal Musk believes is critical to advancing space exploration. The upper stage of Starship continued its flight around Earth, splashing down successfully in the Indian Ocean.

The success of this mission pushes SpaceX closer to its goal of [sending humans to Mars](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/09/spacex-launch-mars-elon-musk-starship/75145498007/). The “chopsticks” catch mechanism captured the booster seven minutes after liftoff, dangling it above the launch pad. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson congratulated SpaceX, calling it a significant step toward the future of lunar exploration under NASA’s Artemis program.

### Indigenous or Columbus?

Indigenous Peoples’ Day, celebrated on the second Monday of October, recognizes the history, culture, and contributions of Native American communities. It is an alternative to Columbus Day, which traditionally honored the Italian explorer [Christopher Columbus](https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus). The movement to replace Columbus Day began in the 1990s, as activists highlighted the atrocities associated with European colonization.

Columbus Day became a federal holiday in 1937. [Indigenous Peoples’ Day](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/13/indigenous-peoples-day/75590291007/), on the other hand, began gaining traction in 1992, during the 500th anniversary of Columbus’s landing, as Native American groups pushed for a more accurate representation of history. South Dakota was the first state to officially recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day.

Today, Columbus Day remains a federal holiday, with many states and cities celebrating both. Meanwhile, other states have entirely replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day.

### Stalin Statue in Russia

According to regional governor Georgy Filimonov, a new life-size statue of [Joseph Stalin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/articles/zhv747h) will be unveiled in Russia’s Vologda region following public requests. While Stalin’s legacy of mass repression and famine remains controversial, the governor emphasized the importance of recognizing Russia’s history, even when interpretations are "ambiguous." The statue will stand near a museum where Stalin was exiled between 1911 and 1912.

The decision to honor Stalin with a [new statue](https://www.politico.eu/article/back-to-the-future-russia-unveil-new-stalin-statue/) reflects ongoing nostalgia for the Soviet Union in some parts of Russia. At the same time, many remain divided over Stalin’s role in Russian history, with some celebrating his leadership and others remembering the political repression and human suffering during his rule. Plans for a monument to [Ivan the Terrible](https://www.biography.com/royalty/a45896491/ivan-the-terrible) were also announced.

### Harris Health Report

Vice President Kamala Harris released her medical report, highlighting her [excellent health and mental fitness](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/g-s1-28012/harris-releases-medical-report-drawing-another-contrast-with-trump) for the presidency. Harris, 59, detailed her physical wellness, daily workouts, and minor health issues like allergies and nearsightedness. This move contrasted with former President Donald Trump, 78, who only released brief health summaries, including a [2023 report](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/da9bdc90-9ab2-4da8-819b-6fda5240a337) declaring him in “excellent” health, but without substantial details. Harris accused Trump of hiding critical health information, especially after questions surrounding his cognitive fitness and disjointed public speeches. As the election neared, health transparency became a significant issue.

Harris’ campaign stressed Trump’s age and his increasingly erratic public appearances as potential signs of decline, while Trump’s camp countered that he had voluntarily provided health information over the years. Despite the defense, many critics believe Trump has strategically withheld crucial details about his physical and cognitive abilities.
