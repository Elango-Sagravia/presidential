### Harris Celebrates 60 on the Trail

![](/images/kamala-harris-celebrated-her-60th-birthday-campaigning-in-georgia-kwMz.webp)

Kamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday [by campaigning](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241020-harris-trump) in Georgia alongside Stevie Wonder, who performed at a church and emphasized unity and responsibility. Harris focused on compassion and support for families, contrasting her message with that of her opponents, whom she accused of "spreading hate."

Meanwhile, Donald Trump reached out to blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania by serving fries at a McDonald's and making a lighthearted jab at Harris’s [previous job](https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-work-mcdonalds-donald-trump-election-2024-1950020). This event followed a few days after Harris expressed concerns about the president’s [physical health](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-questions-trump-health-medical-records/). With the election just weeks away, both candidates target key swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania during their final campaign pushes.

### Italy Bans Surrogacy Abroad

Italy has passed a law criminalizing citizens who seek [surrogacy abroad](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62rmv63069o), imposing penalties of up to two years in prison and fines of up to €1 million. While the law is meant to protect surrogates from exploitation and uphold traditional family values, critics argue it disproportionately targets same-sex couples and lacks clarity on implementation.

Opposition parties and LGBTQ+ activists have protested the measure, labeling it discriminatory and legally problematic, particularly regarding retroactive enforcement and the regulation of foreign birth certificates. While some may find this law infringing on freedoms, some also see how the surrogacy industry can present problems. See the list of countries where surrogacy is legal [here](https://www.ivfconceptions.com/countries-where-surrogacy-is-legal/).

### German Peace Prize

Anne Applebaum, a distinguished historian and journalist, recently received the [prestigious Peace Prize](https://apnews.com/article/germany-peace-prize-ukraine-applebaum-c1106c4393acbd5f7aea61d975a15247) of the German Book Trade during a ceremony held in Frankfurt. In her speech, she strongly advocated for sustained support for Ukraine as it faces ongoing aggression from Russia. Applebaum cautioned that adopting a pacifist stance in such situations can often lead to dangerous appeasement, where the aggressor is encouraged rather than deterred.

She also challenged the prevalent [discussions around peace](https://kyivindependent.com/44-of-ukrainians-believe-its-time-to-start-official-peace-talks-with-russia-survey-finds/), which tend to overlook the severe and destructive repercussions of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While her call for military assistance to Ukraine sparked some debate and criticism, it was met with significant applause from many in the audience who resonated with her message. She recently published a [book](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/725302/autocracy-inc-by-anne-applebaum/) called *Autocracy, Inc.—the Dictators Who Want to Run the World*.
