Here is some bad news for those who like to collect passport stamps. The EU finally gave the green light to the new automated Entry/Exit System (EES), which will launch on 10 November 2024. The EES will register non-EU visitors digitally, [removing the need for physical stamps](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2024/08/22/end-of-an-era-for-passport-stamps-new-eu-entry-system-will-register-travellers-digitally). Also, once this is adequately implemented, all travelers to the EU with visa-free access will have to register for ETIAS, which is an online travel authorization. The authorization will cost 7$ and should be suitable for three years. The online authorization is set to start in early 2025 but could be pushed back again.

### The second largest diamond found in Botswana

A Canadian mining company discovered a 2,492-carat diamond in Botswana, the [second-largest diamond in the world](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/22/worlds-second-largest-diamond-found-in-botswana). The diamond was found via X-ray technology. Botswana is one of the world’s largest producers of diamonds, which is its primary source of income. Lucera didn’t assign a value or mention the quantity but said it's only second to a diamond mined over a century ago in South Africa. The diamond is the size of a palm of a hand. Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi posed with the massive stone. This is a good find for the company and Botswana.

### Protests in Indonesia

Thousands of protestors have been demonstrating in front of Indonesia’s parliament; some have even tried to storm it. The reason for this is changes in law regarding elections. Indonesian police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse [thousands of protesters](https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-protest-jokowi-widodo-345949895cc83bd18abcd90f2d1a9715) who attempted to enter the parliament building after they tore down a section of fence and threw rocks at police. Many protestors believe that implementing these changes would prolong the political influence of Indonesian President Joko Widodo after his leave and weaken Indonesia's democracy.

### Hungary celebrates over 1000 years this week

Hungary had the [largest fireworks display in Europe](https://www.euronews.com/2024/08/21/europes-largest-fireworks-display-goes-off-with-a-bang-in-hungary) this week. They celebrated their statehood day. The Hungarian state is over 1000 years old. Local media reports suggest that the event, which included drones, fireworks, and voice-over narration, cost over €38 million to stage at the five-kilometer stretch of the Danube River's banks. The celebration was delayed an hour because of the rain, but it was successful. Some complained that Hungarian hospitals lacked many necessities, so putting so much money into this was foolish.

Algeria has been experiencing a [boom in tourism](https://www.africanews.com/2024/08/22/as-algeria-opens-its-doors-to-more-visitors-its-tourism-sector-is-rapidly-expanding-to-hos/) in the last couple of years. It is hungry for more. The government wants to welcome even more visitors to increase the number of annual tourists fivefold by 2030. While Algeria has increased tourism, it still needs to catch up in its tourism sector compared to Morocco and Tunisia. These two countries have cultivated a steady tourist flow for decades. They are also visa-free for many people. Algeria still requires a tourist visa for most people, which can be rather pricey and time-consuming. They recently made it visa-free for those who purchased a desert tour in the south.

### Venezuela's top court endorses Maduro

Venezuela’s controversial election results have been ruled in Maduro’s favor by the Supreme Court of Venezuela. Venezuelans went to the polls on July 28th. Maduro was declared the winner when just 53 % of the votes were counted. The opposition's tally of polling station-level results, published online, showed Gonzalez Urrutia won more than two-thirds of votes. The opposition leader said, “ To the court's judges: no decision will replace the will of the people.” Venezuelans have been increasingly dissatisfied with Maduro’s leadership since he was taken power in 2013. This decision will only continue to add fuel to the fire.

### New Jersey to cancel 100 million in medical debt

The Governor of New Jersey announced Wednesday the state would cancel $100 million in medical debt for nearly 50,000 people. While student debt is a significant hot-button issue in many discussions, medical debt is just as pressing. Many people in the US are financially crippled from medical debt. Healthcare costs in the United States can be enormous, particularly for the uninsured. The Harris campaign is expected to unleash some promises regarding lifting medical debt, such as deleting medical debt from credit scores.
