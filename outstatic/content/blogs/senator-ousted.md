### WV Senator Ousted Over Indecent Exposure

Republican Sen. Mike Maroney was removed from his position as chair of the West Virginia Senate Health and Human Resources Committee following his arrest on charges of indecent exposure and disorderly conduct. The charges stem from an August 4 incident at Gumby’s Cigarette & Beer World in Glen Dale, where surveillance footage allegedly showed Maroney engaging in inappropriate behavior.

Senate President Craig Blair, who described Maroney as a friend, stated that Maroney’s removal was to allow him time to address his personal issues. Maroney, who was defeated in the May primary and has a few months left in his term, had previously been a vocal critic of certain Republican-backed bills, including those related to vaccine exemptions and transgender medical treatments. If convicted, Maroney faces potential penalties, including jail time and fines.

### Crypto PAC Backs Democrats, GOP Fumes

A leading pro-cryptocurrency political group, Fairshake PAC, has invested heavily in Michigan and Arizona Senate races to support Democrats Rep. Ruben Gallego and Rep. Elissa Slotkin against Donald Trump-endorsed candidates. This move has stirred discontent among Republicans, who had previously viewed the crypto industry as an ally.

Fairshake PAC and its affiliates spend approximately $3 million each on these Democratic candidates, aiming to influence key battleground states. This spending contrasts with the group's traditional support for Republican candidates, especially in light of a tense regulatory climate. Fairshake's investments come amid growing GOP efforts to strengthen ties with the crypto industry, which has become a significant source of fundraising and a tool to attract younger voters.

Gallego and Slotkin, previously seen as crypto skeptics, have recently shown more support for crypto initiatives, leading Fairshake to back them. However, their past opposition to crypto-friendly legislation has raised questions about their commitment. The situation has left Republicans worried about losing support from a previously favorable industry, especially with Trump and his allies critical of the group's new stance.

The crypto industry’s involvement in these Senate races reflects broader strategic shifts and regulatory concerns. Fairshake’s actions have sparked debate within GOP circles, with some strategists warning that the group’s support for Democrats could backfire by undermining Trump and harming GOP chances in crucial races. The evolving dynamics highlight the complex interplay between politics and cryptocurrency, with significant implications for both parties and the industry.

### Indian Doctors Protest After Trainee's Death

Doctors across India staged protests demanding better protections for healthcare workers following the rape and murder of a female resident doctor in Kolkata on Wednesday. The incident has ignited widespread anger and calls for a federal investigation into hospital security and violence against medical staff.

The protests, which have led to the suspension of elective procedures, highlight systemic issues in India's healthcare system and the broader problem of violence against women. The Indian Medical Association reported that over 75% of doctors have faced violence, exacerbating the calls for a new Central Healthcare Protection Act to enhance security measures in hospitals.

Despite some concessions from the government, including forming a committee to draft new legislation, many doctors and medical associations continue to demand immediate action and improved safety protocols.

### WHO Declares New Mpox Emergency

The World Health Organization has reissued a global health emergency declaration for Mpox due to a severe outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has spread to neighboring African countries. This highest alert level designation aims to boost international cooperation and resources to control the virus.

The outbreak has seen over 17,000 suspected cases and 517 deaths this year, marking a significant increase from 2023. The virus, especially the more transmissible clade I strain, is causing alarm as it spreads through close contact and poses serious health risks.

In response, the WHO and CDC are enhancing surveillance and advising travelers to affected regions to take precautions. While the U.S. has managed a decrease in Mpox cases, officials remain vigilant for potential new cases and support vaccine distribution to mitigate the spread.

### North Korea to Reopen for Tourism

This move comes after North Korea resumed international flights and hosted a few foreign dignitaries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The city of Samjiyon, near the Chinese border, has been developed with new facilities, including hotels and a ski resort, as part of the country's effort to showcase its “socialist utopia.”

### Walmart Cautious Yet Upbeat Amid Uncertainty

Walmart is cautious about the financial health of its shoppers but does not foresee a major downturn, according to CFO John David Rainey. Despite uncertainties like the 2024 election and Middle East unrest, Walmart's consumer activity has remained stable, with retail sales unexpectedly rising in July.

Rainey noted that while shoppers are still seeking discounts and focusing on essentials, spending has not decreased significantly. Walmart's revenue grew nearly 5% this quarter, driven by increased store visits and promotions, including a surge in price rollbacks on food items.

Overall, Walmart's stability is attributed to low inflation and consumer shifts towards home cooking over dining out, reflecting a broader trend of cautious but resilient spending behavior.

### Trader Joe’s Recalls Candles Over Fire Risk

Trader Joe’s recalls 653,000 Mango Tangerine scented candles due to a fire hazard. The candles, sold in June, can produce larger-than-expected flames as the fire spreads from the wick to the wax.

The company has received reports of minor property damage and burns from the candles. Affected customers can return the candles to any Trader Joe’s store for a $4 cash refund or complete an online form for a $4 gift card.

### Notre Dame Halts Men’s Swim Team Over Scandal

Notre Dame has suspended its men’s swimming program for at least one academic year following an external investigation that confirmed violations related to gambling and team culture. Athletic Director Pete Bevacqua stated that the findings were contrary to the university’s values and necessitated a full suspension to address the cultural issues within the team.

The investigation revealed numerous NCAA rule violations, including gambling on intercollegiate swimming, despite ongoing training on these rules. The suspension does not affect the women’s swimming or diving teams, and the coaching staff has not been disciplined. The affected swimmers may transfer to other schools but will carry any disciplinary actions with them.
