### Election showdown

![Voters prepare for the election showdown determining the next US president](/images/elections-QxNj.webp)

The upcoming 60th [US presidential election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/us-presidential-election-trump-harris) will be a defining moment in American politics, determining not only the 47th president but also the 50th vice president. This year has seen record-breaking fundraising for campaigns. The media landscape is intensely polarized, featuring extensive coverage across various platforms. In addition to the presidential race, all 435 House and 34 Senate seats are contested, alongside numerous state and local elections, highlighting the election’s far-reaching implications.

Voters in 41 states will vote on 159 ballot initiatives. Florida voters will decide on legalizing [marijuana](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/florida-vote-marijuana-abortion-election-test-gops-dominance-115458592), while Puerto Rico’s [independence movement](https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-election-dalmau-pnp-ppd-cf7543357d219fb695a96b863b5fcf11) candidate is gaining traction. Ten states have abortion rights on the ballot. It’s very likely a decision will not be reached tonight. The ballots will take some time to count and possibly recount, especially in crucial swing states.

### Iran student protest

A female student in Tehran was recently [arrested](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20241104-woman-strips-off-clothes-at-iran-university-in-apparent-protest) after protesting Iran’s strict dress code by stripping her underwear in public. The student, whose identity remains undisclosed, reportedly took this action after members of the Basij paramilitary force allegedly harassed her at Islamic Azad University by tearing her headscarf and clothes. In response, she removed her clothes in defiance, sitting outside the university and later walking in public. 

Videos of her protest circulated widely on social media, showing the woman’s arrest by plainclothes officers who reportedly handled her with force. Amnesty International called for her immediate and unconditional [release](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vngeezwvno), urging authorities to investigate alleged abuses and protect her from mistreatment. This protest recalls the [2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20240916-two-years-after-death-mahsa-amini-quiet-revolution-in-iran-women-protest-reformers), where thousands protested the death of a young woman arrested for violating Iran’s dress code.

### China’s marriages

China’s marriage rates are [plummeting](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/04/china/china-marriages-on-track-low-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=Some%204.74%20million%20Chinese%20couples,of%20Civil%20Affairs%20on%20Friday.), with 4.74 million marriages recorded in the first three quarters of 2024—a 16.6% decline from the previous year. This trend, which began after a peak in 2013, poses challenges for China as marriages correlate directly with birth rates, impacting the country’s aging workforce and economy. Government [campaigns](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1016078) to boost marriage and childbirth, such as offering incentives, organizing matchmaking events, and addressing dowry costs, have had limited success.

Many young people are choosing not to marry. They cite economic instability, high living costs, and shifting social values as some of the reasons. Young women, in particular, are prioritizing education and independence, diverging from traditional roles. This trend mirrors similar struggles in Japan and South Korea, where birth-encouraging policies have met with limited success. These patterns are uncommon in Western countries; marriage and birth rates are also decreasing in the US and Europe.
