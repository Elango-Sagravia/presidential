### Election aftermath

Kamala Harris officially [conceded](https://www.dw.com/en/us-election-result-donald-trump-wins-over-kamala-harris-v2/live-70708290) to Republican Donald Trump in a [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUouF8oDbs) at Howard University on Wednesday. In it, she thanked her supporters and urged them to continue their efforts to bring about change. Trump also won the popular vote, becoming the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004. Trump [celebrated](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181584/trump-celebrates-historic-win-in-speech) his historic win, promising to usher in a “golden age of America.” 

Trump’s win was both broad and strategic. His [campaign](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/7/us-election-results-how-did-donald-trump-break-the-blue-wall) aimed to reshape American electoral coalitions, reaching out to traditionally Democratic constituencies such as union members, working-class families, and Black and Latino men. At the same time, he appealed to those who had grown disillusioned with the political process, especially men in overlooked communities who felt abandoned by both parties.

### Dollar and Bitcoin soars

![Trump's election win drives U.S. markets to record highs, with Tesla and Bitcoin soaring](/images/dollar-and-bitcoin-soar-as-trump-wins-presidency-k4Nz.png)

After Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, stock markets reached [record highs](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/stocks-and-bitcoin-soar-after-trumps-victory-while-inflation-worries-rise-dow-surges-1200), with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all surging. [Tesla stock](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla) increased by 14%. Bitcoin also reached a new [all-time high](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) of $75,000. However, long-dated Treasury yields increased, pricing in the risk of tariff hikes. Bonds rise in times of uncertainty. Globally, European and emerging markets fell, reacting negatively to uncertainties associated with these tariffs.

Oil and gold prices were volatile; oil prices rose slightly while gold fell. Additionally, the [dollar strengthened](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-DXY/) against multiple currencies as parked offshore, waiting for election results to flow back into the country. Republicans appear set to control Congress, boosting optimism for Trump’s economic policies [(track markets)](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets).

### AI cancer trials

![Cancer Research UK funds a £5.9 million AI-driven project to accelerate radiotherapy trials](/images/scientists-use-ai-to-mimic-cancer-patient-trials-QzMD.png)

Cancer Research UK has [invested £5.9 million](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew200d79nlo) in a groundbreaking project led by the University of Manchester and The Christie Hospital. This initiative aims to revolutionize clinical trials for radiotherapy by using advanced artificial intelligence to develop virtual trials with real-world patient data. The AI will simulate patient groups to test various treatments, speeding up research and cutting costs.

The study will focus on personalized cancer treatment, comparing the efficacy of proton beam therapy to conventional radiotherapy for lung cancer patients. By tailoring treatments to individual needs, the initiative aims to enhance outcomes. The project aims to improve clinical trial efficiency, speed up therapy development, and potentially save more lives through targeted strategies. This innovative approach could significantly advance cancer research and transform cancer care.
