### Brazil vs. Musk again

![Elon Musk at a G20 event in Rio de Janeiro](/images/brazillian-first-lady-cusses-out-elon-musk-at-g20-conference-QwNT.webp)

Brazil’s First Lady, Janja Lula da Silva, [stirred controversy](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/18/business/brazil-first-lady-elon-musk-g20-intl/index.html) during a G20 event by jokingly swearing at Elon Musk while discussing social media regulation. She remarked, “I’m not afraid of you, F\*\*\* you, Elon Musk,” to which Musk responded with a laughing emoji and a comment about political consequences for the Brazilian government. 

This incident occurred at the [G20 summit](https://www.g20.org/en/) in Rio de Janeiro, where leaders convened to address global issues. Musk's platform, X, had previously [faced legal trouble](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/31/x-offline-brazil-elon-musk) in Brazil for not complying with court orders to block accounts spreading misinformation. After a one-month suspension, X [resumed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-attorney-general-backs-reinstating-social-medial-platform-x-2024-10-08/) operations in Brazil. This rift showcases ongoing conflicts between Musk and governments tackling his online platform. Brazil's [president](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/tech/brazil-lula-elon-musk-x-suspension-hnk-intl/index.html) has criticized Musk for not adhering to local laws and his far-right ideology.

### Ballet world in mourning

Vladimir Shklyarov, a world-renowned Russian ballet star and principal dancer at the Mariinsky Theatre, [tragically died](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/18/style/vladimir-shklyarov-ballet-death-scli-intl/index.html) after falling from the fifth floor of a building in St. Petersburg. His death is under investigation but is believed to be accidental, with reports indicating he had been taking strong painkillers before the incident. He was scheduled for complex spinal surgery before the fall.

Shklyarov joined the Mariinsky Theatre in 2003 and became a principal dancer in 2011. He was known for performing in significant productions like Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty. He earned numerous accolades, including the Leonide Massine International Prize. At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he expressed his[ opposition to the war](https://www.yahoo.com/news/russian-ballet-dancer-critical-putin-195936289.html), voicing support for peace. Shklyarov is survived by his wife, dancer Maria Shirinkina, and their two children, leaving the global ballet community in mourning.

### The Attorney General

Matt Gaetz, the Florida lawmaker Trump nominated as the next U.S. Attorney General, is at the center of [multiple allegations](https://alabamareflector.com/2024/11/19/heres-what-we-know-about-the-investigations-into-matt-gaetz/) that could jeopardize his confirmation. These include accusations of sex with a minor, bribery, drug use, and misuse of campaign funds. A congressional ethics committee has been investigating these claims since 2021, with several women backing up them; some have documentation to support them.

Although a federal investigation into these allegations was closed without charges, Gaetz is still under scrutiny from the ethics committee. His nomination has sparked significant controversy, with many urging the report on his conduct to be made public. The case could affect Gaetz’s chances of confirmation in the Senate, where he needs 50 votes, with potential opposition from Democrats and [Republicans](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5191708/gaetz-nomination-republicans-ethics-probe). Trump, however, continues to [support Gaetz](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/trump-matt-gaetz-confirmation-senate), dismissing the allegations as baseless attempts to derail his administration.
