### Activist Seeks Asylum in France

Paul Watson, the founder of Sea Shepherd, has been in Danish custody since July, facing possible [extradition to Japan](https://apnews.com/article/sea-shepherd-france-paul-watson-whaling-japan-7b52f47f5f35c86ae83d56d44e893758) over a 2012 incident involving a whaling vessel. Watson, 73, is accused of attacking the ship and injuring a crew member with a stink bomb. He could face up to 15 years in prison if extradited and convicted.

A French resident, Watson wrote a letter from prison to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging intervention. While the president’s office is “following the situation closely,” no official response has been made. Shepherd and [Watson’s supporters](https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/09/05/eu-lawmakers-call-for-release-of-marine-activist-paul-watson-in-denmark), including Brigitte Bardot and Pierce Brosnan, have rallied in France, pushing for his release and opposing [Japan’s whaling practices](https://apnews.com/article/japan-commercial-whaling-fin-whale-7d9aba49ed69f241204df8a05f720205).

### Texas Man Spared Execution

The Texas Supreme Court [halted the scheduled execution](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/17/us/robert-roberson-texas-execution-lawfulness/index.html) of Robert Roberson, convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002. His conviction was tied to shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis now questioned by medical experts. Roberson’s supporters, including bipartisan lawmakers, argue his daughter died from complications related to pneumonia, not abuse.

Lawmakers issued a subpoena for Roberson to testify before a Texas House committee next week, invoking a rarely-used legal maneuver. The ruling came after hours of last-minute appeals. Roberson, who has autism, has maintained his innocence, and his lawyers argue that flawed science led to his conviction. He now awaits further legal proceedings while his testimony is scheduled for Monday—the U.S. is the only remaining Western country that practices the [death penalty](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45835584). It is a divisive issue that many people have strong feelings about. Currently, 23 states have abolished it, while 27 still allow it.

### Secret Service Failings

An independent review of the [assassination attempt](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-butler-rally-return-secret-service/) on former President Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 has pointed to some serious issues within the Secret Service. The report, put together by a group of law enforcement officials, highlighted [significant flaws](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-butler-rally-shooting-independent-investigation-secret-service-deep-flaws-needs-fundamental-reform/) in the agency’s operations and communication, which allowed the [shooting](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-biden-trump-07-13-24/index.html) that left one person dead and others injured [(read full review)](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1017_opa-Independent-Review-Panel-Final-Report-and-Accompanying-Materials.pdf). They criticized the agency’s leadership and suggested it was time for new leaders with outside experience to step in.

Acting Director Ronald Rowe, who took over after Kimberly Cheatle resigned, has committed to making changes and improving security protocols. He’s about enhancing coordination with local law enforcement and boosting protective measures. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas backed these recommendations and emphasized the agency's need for long-term transformation.

### Biden Strengthens Transatlantic Ties

President Joe Biden visited Berlin, where he was awarded Germany’s Grand Cross of the Order of Merit [(watch video)](https://www.dw.com/en/biden-meets-allies-in-berlin/video-70539143). He met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This was a farewell visit and an attempt to strengthen Transatlantic ties before the US presidential elections. Their talks focused on [Ukraine and the Middle East](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-berlin-ukraine-european-allies/). The leaders reaffirmed support for Ukraine against Russia’s aggression and discussed President Zelenskyy’s [victory plan](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-victory-plan-unveiled-zelenskyy-parliament-f3525550f6986f590777193a7385c0c5), including using [frozen Russian assets](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/11/frozen-russian-assets-and-35-million-eu-loan-to-ukraine-whats-at-stake) to aid Ukraine.

They also addressed the death of [Hamas leader](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/18/world/what-next-for-hamas-intl/index.html) Yahya Sinwar, calling for the release of Israeli hostages and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza. British Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the urgent need for Gaza aid while backing Israel’s right to self-defense. The leaders remain committed to stabilizing both regions.
