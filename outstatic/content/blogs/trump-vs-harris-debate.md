### Trump and Harris Prepare for First Presidential Debate

After days of speculating on whether this would even happen, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are expected to have the first [presidential debate](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate/index.html) today. The Debate will be at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. It is a valuable location as Pennsylvania is one of the major swing states where both candidates are neck and neck in the polls.

It will be moderated by ABC anchors Linsey Davis and David Muir and will last 90 minutes. Microphones will be turned on when it’s their turn to speak and muted otherwise. Harris is a bit disadvantaged by this as she doesn’t get to use her who hoped to tap into her skills as a former prosecutor to engage with Trump.

### Family of Shot American Activist Demands Independent Investigation

The family of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a Turkish-American activist killed in the West Bank, is urging the U.S. government to launch an [independent investigation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/7/family-demands-independent-probe-into-killing-of-us-activist-in-west-bank) into her death. Eygi, a member of the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement, was reportedly shot by an Israeli sniper. While Israeli officials claim she was throwing rocks at troops, witnesses dispute this version of events.

Her family believes the Israeli investigation was insufficient and is calling on the Biden administration for further action. So far, there has been no official response from the U.S. government.

### Boeing Offers 25% Wage Increase to Avoid Strikes

Boeing has reached a tentative deal with workers to avoid a major [strike](https://www.dw.com/en/boeing-offers-25-pay-rise-to-avoid-strike/a-70167370). The aerospace giant agreed to a 25% wage increase and promised to build its next commercial airplane at its Seattle-based plants. The union representing them initially sought a 40% raise, but they said it was one of the best contracts they managed to negotiate.

Boeing has faced several setbacks recently, including issues with its 737 MAX planes and a malfunction with its Starliner spacecraft. This deal represents a step towards restoring its credibility, though the company still has work to do.

### India’s Supreme Court Orders Doctors to End Strike

India’s [Supreme Court has ordered](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3277803/indias-top-court-orders-protesting-doctors-resume-work-amid-outcry-over-kolkata-rape?module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article) striking doctors to return to work immediately or face disciplinary action. The strike, sparked by the recent rape and murder of a female doctor, has seen hundreds of doctors across the country halt their work to demand justice and improved conditions in government hospitals.

The court also directed regional authorities to address the doctors' concerns. However, many believe these steps fall short, calling for greater accountability. Public frustration has mounted as only two arrests have been made in connection with the murder, despite indications that more people were involved.

​​Thousands of people have taken to the streets in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, to demand the [release](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/8/thousands-protest-in-pakistan-to-demand-ex-pm-imran-khans-release) of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been imprisoned for over a year. Many of his supporters believe the charges are trumped up and politically motivated.

Khan’s party has accused police of deliberately obstructing the protests, while authorities allege protesters threw rocks at officers. Khan was ousted in a 2022 no-confidence vote and faces charges of inciting violence in May 2023 when his supporters attacked a military installation.

### International Manhunt for Suspect Who Threw Hot Coffee on Baby

Australian police have launched an [international manhunt](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8drzm09j0o) for a 33-year-old man accused of pouring boiling coffee on a nine-month-old baby in Brisbane. The attack, which occurred on August 31st, left the infant with severe burns to the face and limbs, requiring urgent medical treatment.

The suspect fled the country six days after the incident, departing from Sydney Airport. Authorities are now collaborating with international agencies, including Interpol, to track his whereabouts. The motive for the attack remains unclear. If convicted, the man faces charges that could result in a life sentence, and his attempt to flee is likely to worsen the legal consequences.

### US Republicans Criticize Biden’s Afghanistan Withdrawal in New Report

US Republicans released a report sharply criticizing President Biden’s handling of the [Afghanistan withdrawal](https://www.dw.com/en/us-republican-report-blasts-biden-on-afghanistan-withdrawal/a-70167472), citing chaos and the deaths of 13 US troops in a suicide bombing at Kabul airport. The report alleges Biden’s decision was driven solely by his determination to exit Afghanistan.

Democrats counter that the report is selective, emphasizing that Biden inherited the withdrawal timeline from former President Trump’s agreement with the Taliban. Other investigations, including one by the US State Department, have assigned responsibility to both Biden and Trump for the withdrawal's challenges.
