### Jimmy Carter Votes for Harris

Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter [voted](https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-vote-cast-president-1f868b295111d0b7f2d6acfd087c9166) by mail for the 2024 election just after celebrating his [100th birthday](https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-100th-birthday-1e540c277dea07bd84242d290b4ebcdc). Carter remains engaged in the election despite being in hospice care since 2023 at his home in Plains, Georgia. He said his main goal was to live and see Kamala Harris take the presidency.

His son Chip Carter mentioned that his father had been looking forward to voting, specifically for Kamala Harris. Georgia’s election rules state absentee ballots are valid once received, even if the voter passes away before Election Day. His vote could influence Georgian voters, and Georgia is one of the states that might determine the presidential election's outcome.

His death has shocked fans and the music industry, with tributes pouring in. Payne was a member of the global phenomenon [One Direction](https://apnews.com/ddb64a872b944032b7624fefc950bfd2). After the band went on hiatus, Payne pursued a solo career with songs like *Strip That Down* and *For You*.

### 1 Billion Live in Acute Poverty

![UN report reveals 1.1 billion people in acute poverty](/images/un-report-says-1.1-billion-people-live-in-acute-poverty-worldwide.--1--cxNT.webp)

Thursday was [International Poverty Eradication Day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/day-for-eradicating-poverty). A recent UN Development Program report highlights that [1.1 billion people](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241017-un-report-says-1-1-billion-people-in-acute-poverty) worldwide live in acute poverty, with [children](https://apnews.com/article/africa-nigeria-unicef-malnutrition-children-8e871e46268fdd4780c7e853f931dca8) making up over half of this number. Conflict significantly exacerbates poverty, with rates three times higher in war-torn nations, particularly affecting 455 million people. India leads in extreme poverty, with 234 million affected, followed by Pakistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Given recent years' high global conflict levels, the report stresses the need for poverty reduction and sustained peace efforts. Poverty reduction methods can include aid and government support in health, education, and infrastructure, which helps growth by increasing human and physical capital.

### Harris, Trump Battle for Black Voters

In Georgia, Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are vying for support from Black male voters—a demographic showing an [increased interest in Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/17/trump-georgia-democrats-black-voters-00184094). Former President Bill Clinton joined Harris on the campaign trail in rural Georgia, acknowledging the state’s importance in the election. Despite Trump’s efforts, Harris continues to enjoy strong backing from Black women voters, who support her domestic policies favoring women and minorities.

Former President Obama has also been campaigning for Harris, mainly focusing on Black male voters in Pennsylvania [(see previous issue)](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/weight-loss-drug-in-france-whopping-cough-rises-obama-for-harris). While there are shifts in preference among Black male voters, polls still show that Black voters in swing states, including Georgia, overwhelmingly favor Harris, making this a critical voting bloc for the election [(polls data)](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-maintains-strong-lead-black-swing-state-voters-new-poll-rcna175420).
