The Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo has officially opened its doors to the public, showcasing a rich collection of artifacts from ancient Egypt [(see photos)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdjpdd18yo). Visitors can now explore remarkable exhibits, including mummies and intricately designed coffins, which offer insights into the burial practices of ancient civilizations. The museum will also be housing a vast collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts, including the treasures of Tutankhamun.

This partial opening is a significant milestone toward the museum’s complete inauguration, which aims to attract global attention and enhance cultural tourism in Egypt. The [Grand Egyptian Museum](https://grandegyptianmuseum.org/) has been under construction for approximately 15 years, with its initial groundbreaking in 2002. However, it faced numerous delays due to various challenges, including financial constraints and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Early Voting in Georgia

Georgia experienced a record-breaking 415,688 ballots cast on the [first day of early voting](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-harris-election-georgia-early-voting-county-breakdown-1970000), surpassing the previous high of 136,000 recorded in 2020. This surge indicates strong Republican mobilization, with both candidates locked in a tight race; Trump currently leads by just 1 point. Notably, populous counties like Fulton and Cobb, historically leaning Democratic, accounted for a significant portion of the votes [(see polls data)](https://www.newsweek.com/georgia-first-day-early-voting-record-election-2024-1969476).

In another related update, [German export trade](https://www.dw.com/en/german-exports-to-us-reach-new-high-as-election-looms/a-70510067) to the U.S. has reached its highest level in 20 years. The differing trade policies of candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump could significantly impact this trend. Harris is likely to continue supporting multilateral trade policies, while Trump advocates for potential tariffs that could reduce German exports by 15%.

### King Charles to Australia

King Charles is poised to embark on his inaugural official [visit to Australia](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/australia-awaits-king-charles-first-big-overseas-tour-cancer-diagnosis-rcna175654) as monarch, an event of considerable importance as it marks his first significant trip following his [cancer diagnosis](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/king-charles-diagnosed-cancer-rcna137293). This visit has rekindled the ongoing debate within Australia regarding its political structure, specifically the nation's identity as a constitutional monarchy, compared to the prospect of transitioning to a republic.

Recent polls indicate a slight majority of Australians still support the monarchy, though the royal visit has elicited various reactions among the populace. The king's ties to Australia, forged while studying at the Australian National University, imbue the trip with added emotional resonance. His visit coincides with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Samoa, highlighting the broader context of Commonwealth relations and cooperation.

### North Korea's Mass Military Drive

North Korea has reported that approximately 1.4 million young people, including students and youth league officials, have volunteered to [join or rejoin the military](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/16/north-korea-claims-1-4-million-apply-to-join-army-amid-tensions-with-south). This mass recruitment drive comes after the [allegations against South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/north-korea-south-korea-drones-accusations-pyongyang) for sending drones into North Korean airspace, which Pyongyang describes as a severe provocation.

In retaliation, North Korea has blown up sections of roads along the [border](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/trump-putin-talks-north-korea-closes-border-israel-s-retaliation) and intensified its rhetoric, warning that any further incursions will be considered a declaration of war. South Korea, while denying the drone allegations, has issued warnings in response to the escalating situation. The explosive environment highlights the ongoing friction on the Korean Peninsula.
