### THE BIG ONE

**The Maori fight**

![](/images/maori-gyMj.webp)

Thousands of Māori individuals and supporters are [protesting](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/19/why-are-new-zealands-maori-protesting-over-colonial-era-treaty-bill) against the Treaty Principles Bill introduced by the ACT Party in New Zealand. The bill seeks to redefine the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-brief), emphasizing equality among all citizens and aiming to eliminate “race-based politics.” Critics, including Māori activists, argue it undermines Māori rights and self-determination, protected in the Māori version of the Treaty.

Protests, including a significant nine-day [hikoi](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ckgrwem73gmt), have erupted. The protests also express broader discontent with government policies on Maori affairs. Although the protests are intense, the bill is unlikely to gain enough support in Parliament. There are undeniable ongoing tensions regarding Indigenous rights in New Zealand. There are significant [disparities](https://teara.govt.nz/en/ethnic-inequalities) between the Maori and other New Zealanders on an institutional level regarding health, poverty, and education.

### RECAP

**God's influencer**

Carlo Acutis, a 15-year-old Italian who passed away from leukemia in 2006, will become the Catholic Church’s [first millennial saint](https://www.politico.eu/article/pope-francis-teenage-millennial-saint-carlo-acutis/), Pope Francis announced. Acutis, nicknamed “God’s influencer,” used his computer skills to create a [website](http://www.miracolieucaristici.org/en/Liste/list.html) documenting Eucharistic miracles and became an inspiration for young Catholics. After his beatification in 2020 and the recognition of two miracles attributed to him, he will be canonized in April 2025 during an event focused on children and adolescents. His tomb in Assisi, Italy, has become a pilgrimage site, reflecting his growing legacy amid efforts by the Church to reconnect with younger generations.

**Nazi-looted art for sale**

Nicolas de Largillierre’s famous painting, a symbol of Nazi-looted art, will be [auctioned](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20241121-french-painting-stolen-by-the-nazis-goes-on-auction-at-christie-s-paris) at Christie’s Paris. Baron Philippe de Rothschild previously owned it; the painting was seized during World War II by the Nazi Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg and marked “R437” while stored at [Neuschwanstein Castle](https://www.neuschwanstein.de/englisch/idea/index.htm). Rose Valland, a French Resistance member who secretly documented looted art movements, facilitated its recovery. After its return to France in 1945, the painting was reclaimed by the Rothschild family and later sold to private collectors. The value is estimated to be between €50,000 and €80,000.

**Indian students**

The number of Chinese students pursuing higher education in the United States has [dropped significantly](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/20/us/china-international-students-us-decline-hnk-dst/index.html#:~:text=During%20the%20last%20academic%20year,nonprofit%20Institute%20of%20International%20Education.), reflecting evolving trends in global education and geopolitics. The U.S. was the top destination for Chinese students for over a decade, drawn by its prestige. Still, concerns about safety, [discrimination](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/01/chinese-americans-report-racial-discrimination-asian-hate), and restrictive immigration policies have dampened enthusiasm, especially during and after the Trump administration. At the same time, improved educational opportunities in China and other countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia have offered competitive alternatives. Meanwhile, India has overtaken China as the largest source of international students in the U.S., driven by its youthful population and aspirations in tech and research fields.

### THE BIG QUESTION

**What will happen to Trump's legal issues during his presidency?**

When Donald Trump returns to the presidency, he will be in an extraordinarily unique position. No criminal defendant has ever been elected to the nation’s highest office, and Trump himself was the first former president to face criminal charges. His ongoing [legal issues](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/11/donald-trump-legal-cases-charges/675531/) will raise complex constitutional, legal, and procedural questions.

Federal criminal charges against Trump, such as those related to election interference and the alleged mishandling of classified documents, could be affected by the longstanding [Department of Justice (DOJ) policy](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/what-happens-to-trump-criminal-cases/index.html) against prosecuting a sitting president. In practice, this means federal cases against Trump might be paused or dismissed while he is in office. However, these charges could resurface after he leaves the presidency unless they are resolved beforehand.

State-level criminal cases, such as the charges in Georgia related to alleged election interference, are a different matter. These cases are not subject to the same immunities as federal charges. Even as a sitting president, Trump would have no legal protection from state prosecutions. However, his legal team would likely argue for delays, potentially pushing the trials until after his presidency. This raises questions about whether a sitting president could be compelled to appear in court for state charges, a situation with no clear precedent.

The issue of access to [classified information](https://theconversation.com/trumps-criminal-conviction-wont-stop-him-from-getting-security-clearance-as-president-243104) is equally complex. Normally, criminal charges or allegations of misconduct would disqualify someone from obtaining a security clearance. However, as president, Trump would not require a clearance to access classified material. By virtue of the office, he would have the authority to view and declassify national security information.

Trump’s legal issues as a sitting president would navigate a legal gray area, testing the boundaries of U.S. constitutional law and precedent.
