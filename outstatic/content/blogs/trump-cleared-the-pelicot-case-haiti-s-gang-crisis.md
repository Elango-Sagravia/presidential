### Trump charges dropped

![](/images/prosecutor-drops-federal-criminal-cases-against-trump-c0MT.webp)

A federal judge has [dismissed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jack-smith-dismiss-charges-trump-d-c-election-case/) charges in the 2020 election case against President-elect Donald Trump following a [request](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.281.0_5.pdf) from special counsel Jack Smith. Smith cited Justice Department policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president, regardless of the allegations’ gravity. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan approved dismissing the case without prejudice, allowing it to be refiled after Trump leaves office in 2029.

Trump’s team hailed the decision as a victory for justice, while critics pointed to the policy’s impact on accountability. Smith, who led investigations into Trump’s conduct, is expected to file a final report and resign. The decision ended federal prosecution but left ongoing [state cases](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/25/trump-legal-cases-status) in Georgia and New York. Trump’s [plans](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9zjl2d3m7o) to appoint key legal allies to the Justice Department raise questions about future case handling.

### Dominque Pelicot case

![](/images/prosecutor-requests-20-year-sentence-for-dominique-pelicot-in-mass-rape-trial-g0Nz.webp)

French prosecutors have [requested](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241125-court-moves-to-sentencing-in-french-mass-rape-trial) the maximum 20-year sentence for Dominique Pelicot, accused of drugging and orchestrating the repeated rape of his ex-wife, [Gisele Pelicot](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje0g8x5pggo), by 49 men. The trial, held in Avignon, revealed Pelicot drugged Gisele from 2011 to 2020, facilitating over 200 assaults, many documented in photos and videos. Prosecutor Laure Chabaud called the crimes profoundly grave, stating, “20 years is both too much and too little.”

The case exposed societal failures in addressing consent, with defendants claiming belief in fabricated consent scenarios. Gisele’s courage in demanding public hearings and revealing evidence has made her a [feminist icon](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20241125-collages-as-a-reminder-the-dedicated-women-supporting-gis%C3%A8le-pelicot). Prosecutors also requested a [17-year sentence](https://efe.com/en/uncategorized/2024-11-25/prosecution-seeks-4-to-17-years-for-dominique-pelicots-co-defendants-in-mass-rape-case/) for another man accused of similar crimes. Judges will deliver their ruling in December, marking a critical moment in France’s fight against sexual violence.

### Haiti’s children

Haiti’s gang crisis is escalating; Haiti has seen a [70% rise](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/number-children-recruited-gangs-haiti-soars-70-unicef-116191187) in child recruitment by armed groups over the past year, according to UNICEF. Children, some as young as 12, now comprise half of all gang members. They are coerced or forced into gangs due to pervasive poverty, violence, and the near-collapse of critical services. [Port-au-Prince](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Port-au-Prince,+Haiti/@18.6075969,-72.3472438,11.24z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8eb9dd57503eaa91:0x3cd5815df929aa08!8m2!3d18.594395!4d-72.3074326!16zL20vMGZzMXY?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEyNC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) is a hotspot where 1.2 million children live under constant threat. Armed groups exploit children, using them as fighters or subjecting them to horrific abuses, including sexual violence against girls.

[UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/number-children-haiti-recruited-armed-groups-soars-70-cent-one-year-unicef) calls this trend a grave violation of human rights, urging authorities to prioritize child protection. Meanwhile, vigilantism is surging, with residents fighting back against gang violence. The crisis continues to leave children with deep psychological scars, robbing them of their childhood and future.
