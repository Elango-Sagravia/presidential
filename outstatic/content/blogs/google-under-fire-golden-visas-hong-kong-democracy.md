### Google monopoly

![](/images/google-must-divest-chrome-to-end-monopoly--us-regulators-say-ExOT.webp)

US prosecutors have [demanded](https://www.dw.com/en/google-must-divest-chrome-to-end-monopoly-us-regulators-say/a-70838012) that Google sell its Chrome browser, share data and search results with competitors, and end its dominance in the online search market. The Department of Justice’s proposal aims to break Google’s control over 90% of the search engine market by removing its ability to use Chrome as a gateway for personalized ads.

This move follows Google's significant [antitrust loss](https://www.dw.com/en/us-court-rules-google-is-monopoly-in-antitrust-case/a-69863869) in August when a US court ruled that the company’s payments to secure default search positions on mobile devices were anti-competitive. If the court agrees to the Justice Department’s plan, it could significantly impact Google’s business model, though the company has argued against such drastic actions. A trial on the issue is set for April 2025, with a ruling expected by September.

### Golden visas

Interest in “golden visas” has [surged](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/20/business/golden-visas-americans-trump-election/index.html) among Americans since the recent US election, as many are seeking backup options for Trump’s next presidency. These visas offer residence and often have paths to citizenship in exchange for significant investments, and have seen a notable uptick in inquiries from wealthy individuals. Popular destinations include [European countries](https://www.expatden.com/global/comparing-greece-vs-portugal-golden-visa-which-one-is-better/), particularly Portugal, which offers an affordable and fast-tracked route to EU citizenship. In some countries in the [Caribbean](https://www.expatden.com/global/antigua-and-barbuda-vs-dominica-investment-program/), one can invest in citizenship.

While wealthy individuals may pursue expensive programs in some places, ordinary Americans also explore ways to move abroad due to political instability and social tensions. Many marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ individuals and families with transgender children, are especially concerned about their safety under a potential second Trump term. This has led to a surge in inquiries, as many look to relocate while maintaining their US citizenship.

### Hong Kong democracy

Jimmy Lai, the 77-year-old Hong Kong media mogul and pro-democracy advocate, [took the stand](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/11/20/asia-pacific/politics/jimmy-lai-stand-hong-kong/) for the first time in his trial on Wednesday. He faces charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and advocating secession, which could lead to life imprisonment. Known for criticizing China’s Communist Party, Lai’s newspaper, [Apple Daily](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53734887), supported Hong Kong’s 2019 protests and championed democracy and free speech.

Lai defended his work in his testimony, stating it reflects the values of Hong Kong’s people. He denied supporting secession and denounced independence movements as “crazy.” His case is a testament to the political crackdown in Hong Kong following [China’s national security law in 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838). Lai has been detained for nearly four years, and his health is raising concerns. His trial exemplifies the tensions between the pro-democracy movement and Beijing’s control over the region.
