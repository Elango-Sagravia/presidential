### Imane Khelif Files Legal Complaint Over Cyber-Harassment

![Imane Khelif](/images/12th-aug--khelifs-legal-fight--reynolds---livelys-box-office-wins-g3NT.webp)

Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif has filed a legal complaint in France, alleging “aggravated cyber-harassment” following false claims about her gender during the Paris Olympics. Khelif, who won gold in the women’s welterweight division, was subjected to a barrage of misogynist and racist attacks after her opponent, Angela Carini, withdrew from their match. This led to erroneous claims that Khelif was transgender. Her lawyer has described the harassment campaign against her as “misogynist, racist, and sexist.”

The complaint was submitted to the Paris prosecutor’s special unit for online hate and seeks an investigation, though it does not specify the perpetrators. The legal action aims to address the harmful impact of these attacks. In a related incident, Kirsty Burrows of the IOC’s safeguarding unit reported receiving death threats after defending Khelif against the discriminatory scrutiny and false claims.

The Paris prosecutor’s office is now investigating these threats, which could result in potential prison sentences and fines under French law. Meanwhile, the IOC has expressed its support for Khelif, condemning the discriminatory scrutiny of her sex and the baseless accusations leveled against her.

### Ukraine Launches Offensive in Russia’s Kursk Region

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that Ukrainian forces are conducting an offensive in Russia's western Kursk region, marking a significant shift in the war's dynamics. The assault, involving up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, has been ongoing throughout the week with battles still in progress. In response, the Russian military has resorted to bombing its own territory to contain the incursion. This has led to the evacuation of over 76,000 people from the Kursk region and the declaration of a state of national emergency.

Social media videos show Ukrainian soldiers removing Russian flags and raising their own in the areas they have occupied. In reaction, Russia has imposed a strict security regime in three border regions and reported the destruction of 14 Ukrainian drones and four ballistic missiles overnight. Additionally, Belarus has increased its military presence along its border with Ukraine.

Amid the offensive, Ukraine is also grappling with internal challenges, including a deadly Russian airstrike on Kyiv using what is suspected to be North Korean missiles. Ukrainian officials continue to call for the destruction of Russian military infrastructure, with Zelenskyy emphasizing the need to maintain pressure on the aggressor.

In the latest box-office showdown, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively both emerged victorious. Reynolds' film, “Deadpool & Wolverine,” topped the charts for a third week, bringing in $54.2 million and surpassing $1 billion globally. Lively’s film, “It Ends With Us,” also performed well, opening strongly with $50 million, exceeding initial forecasts. This family-driven box-office duel echoes past celebrity pairings, such as Bruce Willis and Demi Moore in 1990.

The weekend also featured a notable flop with “Borderlands,” a $120-million video game adaptation that grossed only $8.8 million and received poor reviews. Meanwhile, “Deadpool & Wolverine” continues to set records as one of the highest-grossing Marvel films, joining “Joker” as the only R-rated movies to surpass $1 billion. Lively’s “It Ends With Us,” based on Colleen Hoover’s novel, had a strong opening and is on track to be profitable.

Susan Wojcicki, the influential tech executive who played a pivotal role in shaping Google and YouTube, has died at 56, her husband announced. Wojcicki's journey began in a modest setting, renting out her Menlo Park garage to Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, a crucial start for the search engine giant.

Wojcicki had stepped down from YouTube last year to focus on family and personal projects. Her husband, Dennis Troper, confirmed her passing but provided no further details. She had also faced personal loss with the recent death of their son, Marco.

### U.S. Waterfront Tourism Nears Pre-2020 Levels

Tourism is making a strong comeback at U.S. waterfront destinations, nearing pre-2020 levels, though spending habits vary by income. Sean Bailey of Myrtle Beach’s SkyWheel reported that ticket sales have surpassed 2019 figures, with higher-priced experiences becoming increasingly popular. The U.S. Travel Association forecasts that tourism in 2024 will exceed 2019 levels, largely driven by domestic travel, which is expected to reach $975.6 billion. Despite challenges like inflation and slowing wage growth, affluent tourists are spending generously, while those with lower incomes are more cautious with their budgets.

In Chicago, Robin Harris of Confidence Apparel has observed customers opting for quality over quantity, reflecting a shift in spending habits. Meanwhile, Robert Gomez’s Beat Kitchen Cantina has seen a 30% increase in sales, although other local ventures are experiencing price sensitivity from residents. In Wildwood, N.J., established businesses like Laura’s Fudge and Boardwalk Best are enjoying steady sales, with vacationers adhering to their planned budgets.
