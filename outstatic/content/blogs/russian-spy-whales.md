![Russian spy whales](/images/russian-spy-whale-found-dead--was-famous-over-being-suspected-of-being-a-spy--had-some-type-of-harness-a-kyNj.webp)

A beluga whale who was previously suspected of having been trained as a [spy by Russia was found dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje2p3z8nlyo) off the Norwegian coast. Five years ago, the whale was found in Norwegian waters with a GoPro camera attached to a harness that read "Equipment of St Petersburg." Although it was suspected, animal experts say it is unlikely. The Kremlin didn’t comment on this and went by the name of Hvaldimir. His movements have been tracked since he was found. Hvaldimir was only about 15 years old, which is relatively short for a beluga whale; many live to around 60 or older. The cause of death is still unknown.

### 10,000 US hotel workers strike on Labor Day weekend

Over [10,000 hotel workers from 25 cities](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/business/hotel-strike/index.html) across the US decided to go on strike this weekend. While most of the world celebrates Labor Day on the first Monday in September, it is the first Monday in the US. This is also one of the biggest weekends for travel in the US. Workers say they want higher pay, better conditions, and more staff to help. The union says the travel and hotel industries have recovered from the pandemic, but worker salaries don’t reflect this. The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt, and Marriott. This strike should last several days. Last year, the same union had a strike on the 4th of July.

### Poland marks 85th anniversary of Nazi invasion

On Sunday, [Poland observed the 85th anniversary](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240901-poland-marks-85-years-outbreak-world-war-ii-donald-tusk) of the outbreak of World War 2. The ceremony was traditionally held in Westerplatte, on Poland's Baltic coast, where a German battleship had attacked a Polish fort 85 years ago. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk drew a lot of parallels to the situation in Ukraine to the Nazi invasion of Poland. Tusk and Polish President Andrej Duda brought up the issue of German reparations. For many years, this issue has been a sensitive issue Germany has done enough to compensate Poland for World War 2.

Pope Francis has started a [12-day trip to Asia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/01/pope-francis-asia-pacific-tour-indonesia-papua-new-guinea-catholic-church) and the Pacific region. It’s the most extended trip in his papacy and possibly one of his most challenging. His trip's goal is to reinforce the importance of Asia for the Catholic church and empathize with interfaith dialogue. The destinations on his trip include Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Singapore. The trip was planned for 2020, but COVID-19 delayed it. The trip will rack up to over 20,000 miles by air. Interestingly enough, Popes have only been traveling for the last 50 years. Popes used to remain in the Vatican and travel around Italy traditionally.

### South Korea Investigates Telegram

South Korean police have launched an [investigation into Telegram](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-police-launch-probe-into-telegram-over-online-sex-crimes-yonhap-2024-09-02/). The purpose of the investigation is to look at whether the encrypted messaging app has been complicit in the distribution of sexually explicit deep fakes. Users have complained about being spammed with this material. Telegram has had an exciting month. Its founder has been arrested, and there are many allegations of the app being complicit in sex crimes and terrorism. Police in South Korea last week pledged a crackdown on sexually exploitative deep fake crimes. This isn’t really a coincidence with Durov’s arrest.

### Musk reacts to Brazil’s ban on X

Elon Musk’s platform X(formerly Twitter) has been [disconnected in Brazil](https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-supreme-court-upholds-blocking-elon-musks-x/a-70115172). A judge ruled that his platform had become disconnected. Brazillian President Lula Da Silva says he is satisfied with the decision. Musk was blocked because he did not get a legal representative for the company. Brazilian law requires all internet companies to have a legal representative.

### Greek schools ban mobile phones

This year's school year for Greek kids will have some new changes. [Students can no longer use their phones](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/31/greece-announces-new-rules-banning-mobile-phones-in-schools-from-september) at school. They must keep their mobile phones in their bags during the day. There are also some new rules around cyberbullying. Students who film classmates and ridicule them online face expulsion. Sometimes, they also face expulsion if they photograph or film any teacher or student without permission. The French-speaking part of Belgium, Wallonia, did something similar this year. Many scientific reports have pointed out that mobile phones hinder the student environment. The kids have until the second week to kick their phone addiction.
