### Very demure

![](/images/word-of-the-year-c1ND.webp)

“Demure,” a word that surged in popularity over the summer, has been named Dictionary.com’s 2024 [word of the year](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/26/style/demure-dictionary-2024-word-of-the-year-hnk-intl/index.html). Usage of the word skyrocketed by 1,200% from January to August, mainly due to TikToker Jools Lebron’s [viral videos](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a61865984/very-demure-tiktok-trend/). In these satirical clips, Lebron humorously describes her appearance and behavior as “very demure, very mindful” while exaggerating how she presents herself in various situations.

Traditionally, the term is used to describe reserved or modest behavior. It was most commonly cited in Victorian literature read in high school. Now, the word has taken on a new meaning, especially regarding a person’s appearance and actions in public. [Celebrities](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/25/demure-tiktok-trend-business-bandwagon) like Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez have also embraced the trend. “[Brat](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/01/brat-wins-collins-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2024#:~:text=Though%20Collins%20already%20defined%20%E2%80%9Cbrat,independent%2C%20and%20hedonistic%20attitude%E2%80%9D.)” was named Collins Dictionary’s 2024 word.

### Turkey isn’t that popular

A recent survey from Campbell’s [reveals](https://nypost.com/2024/11/04/lifestyle/most-people-prefer-this-thanksgiving-food-over-turkey-survey-reveals/) that side dishes are the true stars of Thanksgiving, with 55% of Americans preferring them over the turkey. Nearly 40% of participants said they’d be content with just side dishes. The report also highlights that 60% of people enjoy preparing side dishes more than the turkey. Stuffing/dressing claimed the top spot as the favorite side dish in 2024, surpassing mashed potatoes, which dropped to second place. Sweet potatoes and green bean casserole rounded out the top four, while mac and cheese, beloved by Gen Z, slipped from third to fifth place this year.

Another emerging trend with Thanksgiving is that more people [opt not](https://www.lex18.com/news/covering-kentucky/more-americans-opting-to-eat-out-or-order-pre-cooked-meals-for-thanksgiving) to make dinner themselves traditionally; Thanksgiving traditions are evolving as families adapt to a changing economy and lifestyle. Last year, nearly one-third of Americans opted for takeout or delivery, and 20% dined out at restaurants for their holiday meal.

### Haaretz sanctioned

Israel’s government [approved a proposal](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/25/middleeast/israel-sanctions-haaretz-over-comments-intl-hnk/index.html) by Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi on November 24, 2024, mandating that any government-funded body refrain from communicating with or advertising in [Haaretz](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Haaretz). This decision came in response to editorials criticized for undermining Israel’s legitimacy and self-defense.

The immediate trigger was remarks made by Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken during a conference in London, where he expressed support for Palestinian “[freedom fighters](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/haaretz-disavows-own-publisher-calling-palestinians-freedom-fighters)” and criticized Israeli policies. Schocken later clarified that he was not referring to Hamas but to a broader group. The move has sparked controversy, with Haaretz denouncing it as an attack on press freedom, likening it to authoritarian tactics used by leaders like Putin and Erdogan. Media freedom is one of the talking points used to defend Israel.

Israel used to have the [highest ranking](https://rsf.org/en/region/middle-east-north-africa) in terms of media freedom in the Middle East and Northern Africa. However, it lost its spot to Qatar this year.
