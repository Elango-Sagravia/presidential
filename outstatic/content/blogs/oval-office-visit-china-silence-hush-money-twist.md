### A peaceful transfer of power

![President-elect Trump meets President Biden in Washington](/images/white-house-UxMD.webp)

President-elect Donald Trump [returned](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-host-trump-white-house-symbolic-peaceful-transfer-power-rcna179619) to Washington to meet President Joe Biden at a significant moment, marking the peaceful transfer of power. In their brief interaction, Biden emphasized the need for a smooth transition, which Trump acknowledged, mentioning the challenges of political life. This meeting is notable since, after the 2020 election, Trump did not invite Biden to the White House, disputing the results instead.

The outgoing president hosting the president is an old-time [tradition](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/presidential-inaugurations-traditions-transitions). Melania Trump did not attend this visit, but Jill Biden extended a letter to her, ensuring her team's readiness to assist with the transition. The reasons for her [declining this visit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/13/melania-trump-declines-invitation-jill-biden/76252863007/) have yet to be revealed. There is widespread speculation that she might not live in the White House full-time once her husband is inaugurated in January.

### China memorials

Authorities in Zhuhai, China, [removed offerings](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2024/11/13/2003826851) at the site of a car attack that killed 35 people and injured 43, triggering public outrage over the delayed government response and censorship efforts. The attack, allegedly driven by a man angered by his [divorce settlement](https://apnews.com/article/china-crash-crowd-zhuhai-3db25fd49b1313c462bbf4e0214f3834#:~:text=Police%20say%20he%20was%20upset%20about%20his%20divorce,-0%20seconds%20of&text=People%20laid%20floral%20tributes%20and,severely%20injuring%20dozens%20of%20others.), was not initially reported by significant state media, as the government focused instead on promoting the Zhuhai airshow and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s travels.

Security personnel quickly cleared flowers and messages left by citizens, and social media platforms censored posts discussing the incident ([watch video](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zhuhai-car-attack-china-removes-memorials-censors-online-outrage-rcna179917), warning—sensitive). The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs defended the country’s commitment to public safety. However, experts like Hong Kong’s Rose Luqiu noted that the rapid censorship aligns with typical efforts to control narratives around incidents involving mass casualties in China.

### Hush money case

A New York judge [postponed](https://time.com/7175546/trump-hush-money-conviction-decision-delayed/) a decision on whether to overturn President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction related to hush money payments, following a request from Trump’s lawyers to delay and ultimately dismiss the case. Trump’s legal team argued that the case, which centers on allegations of falsified business records concerning a [$130,000 payment](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/13/donald-trump-hush-money-stormy-daniels) to Stormy Daniels, should be put on hold to avoid “unconstitutional impediments” to his ability to govern.

Although Trump was convicted in May, his lawyers cited a recent [Supreme Court ruling](https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/07/justices-rule-trump-has-some-immunity-from-prosecution/) on presidential immunity for past presidents, arguing that evidence presented from his time in office should not have been admitted. The judge will now rule on November 19 after Trump’s attorneys and prosecutors agreed to the delay.
