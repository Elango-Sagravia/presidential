A Second World War veteran decided to mark her 102nd birthday rather unusually. She decided to [jump out](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/25/manette-baillie-britain-oldest-skydiver-suffolk) of a plane for charity. Manette Baillie, from Suffolk, England, jumped out of a plane last week to celebrate her birthday and raise money for three charities. She says these charities are very dear to her heart. She came up with the idea of hearing about it from a friend’s 85-year-old father doing it. She said, “ If he can do it, so can I.” Another one of her reasons for doing it is an Air Ambulance saved her son’s life in a diving accident.

### Norwegian princess marries a famous Shaman

Norway’s Princess Martha Louise and American Durek Verrett [married on Saturday](https://www.dw.com/en/norways-princess-martha-louise-marries-us-shaman/a-70101631) in a private ceremony in western Norway. While still a member of the Norwegian royalty, the Princess handed over her royal duties for her business ventures a few years ago. This is the princess’s second marriage. Durek Verret is a self-proclaimed six-generation shaman who also claims he can talk to spirits. He has been described as a "conspiracy theorist." The couple has been together since 2019. The Princess is also a bit unique in some ways. She claimed in 2007 that she can talk to angels. Regardless of what one may think of their claims, it sounds like they both found their appropriate match.

### Greece in a state of emergency over dead fish

The Greek port city of Volos is in an [emergency](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/30/state-of-emergency-in-greece-as-thousands-of-dead-fish-collect-around-volos-port) because thousands of fish, or 100 tons, have washed into the port. Officials blame the mass deaths on extreme climate fluctuations. The dead freshwater fish filled the bay and nearby rivers after being displaced from their typical habitats by flooding last year and a significant drought. The fish has brought an unpleasant stench, and many fear it could cause an environmental disaster. It also has caused a drain on its tourism industry during the high season.

### Trump's campaign praises Tim Walz’s brother

Political family disputes are not uncommon, but imagine how it would feel to be a vice presidential candidate and have a sibling opposed to your campaign. That is what is happening to Tim Walz. The Trump campaign has praised him for complaining about his [brother’s ideology](https://www.newsweek.com/jeff-walz-praised-maga-donald-trump-opposing-brother-tim-walz-1947203) during his time as governor. While Jeff Walz has not actively campaigned for Trump, he has been outspoken about his brother’s career as governor. JD Vance and Donald Trump have used thesis criticisms to their campaign’s advantage. It is pretty safe to say he will not be appearing for the Harris-Walz campaign in the next two months.

### Chaos over Oasis tickets

Online chaos ensues just hours after Oasis announced their [reunion tour](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/8/31/oasis-fans-struggle-to-secure-tickets-for-british-bands-reunion-tour) for 2025. Recently, Oasis has confirmed their tour with 14 dates announced across the UK. It's the first reunion in over 15 years. Fans from all over the world have scrambled to get one of these tickets. Over one million tickets went on sale Saturday morning, with prices starting at just under 100 dollars. These tickets have broken the internet. Many have struggled to secure tickets from authorized sales sites, and many fans complain about getting error messages or being stuck in over half a million places in the queue.

### Romania deals with floods

Eastern Romania has found itself submerged in [floods](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/01/locals-survey-damage-after-extensive-flooding-in-eastern-romania) this weekend. Luckily, local officials say that despite the extensive property damage, there have been no reports of any casualties. A popular tourist resort is without electricity, and an extensive cleanup operation is underway to repair the beach. Firefighters have been mobilized all over the region. Meteorologists say the cause of the floods was a cyclone storm system that was stationary over the Black Sea. This is unusual for this region. These floods are likely to be another incident caused by climate change.

### Potential antibiotic material in the Arctic sea

Here is some good news for the medical world. Finnish scientists have found microbes under the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean. They say these are “Promising” [antibiotic candidates](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/potential-new-source-for-drugs-to-fight-deadly-viruses-found-deep-in-arctic-ocean/). The discovery rate of fundamentally new antibiotics has been much slower than before. Many diseases have also become increasingly more resistant to antibiotics. This discovery can be helpful in creating new antibiotics and can potentially solve the current global antibiotics crisis. World health experts have forecasted the antibiotic crisis to be one of the public health issues that will become a more pressing issue in the future.
