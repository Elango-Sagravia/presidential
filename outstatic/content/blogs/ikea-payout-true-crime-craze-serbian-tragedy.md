### IKEA pays out

![](/images/ikea-cxNz.jpg)

IKEA has announced a [commitment of €6 million ](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/03/europe/ikea-six-million-gdr-prisoners-intl/index.html#:~:text=Furniture%20giant%20IKEA%20has%20agreed,pressure%20other%20companies%20to%20follow.)(around $6.5 million) to a compensation fund aimed at supporting victims of forced labor during East Germany's communist regime. This decision follows the findings of an independent [investigation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ikea-to-release-report-on-east-german-forced-labor/) that uncovered the disturbing fact that political prisoners were used in the production of IKEA furniture in the 1970s and 1980s. 

[The establishment of this fund marked a significant milestone after years of dedicated advocacy by groups representing the victims, who have long sought acknowledgment and reparations for their suffering. This financial contribution from IKEA aims to ](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/03/europe/ikea-six-million-gdr-prisoners-intl/index.html#:~:text=Furniture%20giant%20IKEA%20has%20agreed,pressure%20other%20companies%20to%20follow.)support those affected and represents a broader movement towards corporate accountability. 

### True crime craze

![](/images/true-crime-s-popularity-I2MT.jpg)

The rise in true crime media has [shifted public perception](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/true-crimes-popularity-brings-real-change-defendants-society-115436113) and occasionally influenced legal outcomes, as seen in the renewed attention to the [Menendez brothers’ case](https://thestatetimes.com/2024/11/01/the-menendez-brothers-resentenced-and-possible-release-soon/). True crime’s popularity grew after 2014’s *Serial*, often reframing convicted individuals as wrongfully accused or deserving leniency. This reflects broader cultural trends in questioning justice systems and exploring the traumatic origins of criminal behavior.

However, experts caution that while media scrutiny can spotlight issues, its sensationalism risks undermining justice processes, fostering public mistrust, and bringing undue distress to victims’ families. Many also say it leads to “armchair lawyers” who don’t always know what they discuss. Despite this, it has been shown that in many cases, there is often more nuance to situations than many initially believe, and the criminal justice system makes mistakes.

### Serbian train

At least 14 people died when a concrete canopy [collapsed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wrp7g05xro) at a railway station in Novi Sad, Serbia. Among the deceased was a young girl. Three others are hospitalized, including two women rescued from the rubble. President Aleksandar Vucic condemned the tragedy, promising accountability for those responsible. The canopy, built in 1964, had not been renovated during recent station updates. The Serbian government declared Saturday a day of mourning for the victims. 

However, some segments of society are demanding more accountability. Hundreds [protested](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/activists-rally-belgrade-protest-railway-station-disaster-2024-11-03/) in Belgrade against the government on Sunday. Demonstrators accused the authorities of negligence and corruption, chanting slogans like “Corruption kills.” The PM stated that investigations are underway, and 26 people, including the Transportation Minister, have been interviewed regarding the incident. The government faces allegations of corruption and ties to organized crime, which the ruling party denies.
