### Germany could raise the drinking age and put an age restriction on TikTok

The German government commissioner for drug-related offenses has said the German drinking age should be raised to 18. He says all forms of alcohol should be at that age. Currently, Germany allows beer and wine to be consumed at 16 or 14 if the parents are present. The commissioner believes alcohol has too much of an effect on young people who aren’t finished physically growing. This isn’t the only thing the commissioner has said that TikTok should also not be allowed for children under 12 and has even stated that it should also be for young teens. While this is just a [recommendation](https://www.dw.com/en/raise-ages-for-drinking-tiktok-german-drug-official-says/a-70068422#:~:text=The%20user%20conditions%20for%20TikTok,when%20a%20parent%20is%20present.), it could be up for discussion in the German parliament in the not-so-far-off future.

The US’s most decorated Olympic gymnast, Simone Biles, stated this week that she intends to seek justice for her teammate, [Jordan Chiles](https://people.com/simone-biles-wants-justice-jordan-chiles-olympic-bronze-medal-dispute-exclusive-8700829). Jordan Chiles was stripped of her Bronze medal from the floor exercise after an appeal was made by the Romanian Olympic committee. Chiles was initially placed in 5th, but after her coach asked for a review from the judge, she was moved to third place. This angered the Romanian team, which had two gymnasts before her. After the Romanian gymnasts protested, the Olympic committee restored the original scores. The reason was that her coach appealed a few seconds too late. Many think the medal should be awarded to both girls, and the judges are to blame.

### Yemen faces Cholera and flash floods

Yemen hasn’t exactly been winning the lottery this week. It has dealt with some [severe floods](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/28/dozens-missing-in-yemen-floods-risk-of-cholera-outbreak-rises) this week. The floods hit al-Mahwit, an area west of the capital. 24 people are reported to be missing so far. To make matters even worse, a clinic has suspected cholera patients, with the rains and floods raising concerns of a major outbreak from contaminated water. The Houthi rebels also control the area. Yemen has been devastated by civil wars, which have damaged a lot of the infrastructure and health services. The issues with climate change have not helped the weather.

Typhoon [Shanshan](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2vk1z2ggo) hit land in the Kagoshima prefecture, the southern island of Kyushu, on Thursday morning. The typhoon left four people dead and many without power. It also left a trail of destruction, with many damaged trees and property. The storm is weaker now and is a tropical storm. However, there is still an emergency in effect. Intense storms are expected to last through the weekend and hit Tokyo. Japanese typhoons are another recent casualty of climate change; they have been coming closer to coastlines and intensifying more rapidly than they did in the past.

### Update on Telegram owner scandal update

French authorities on Wednesday indicted Telegram CEO Pavel Durov on six charges related to [illicit activity](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-charges-telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-released-bail/) on the app. He is now released on a 5 million dollar bail and must remain in France until his trial. He also must check in with the police. France, Russia, and the United Emirates, all of which are countries that Durov is a citizen of, have been in a slight diplomatic row over this arrest. Telegram has been accused of fraud, drug trafficking, organized crime, terrorism promotion, and cyber-bullying on the platform. However, Telegram has said everything is well within European Union standards. Others have said it is unfair that Telegram is singled out while other apps are less scrutinized.

### Germany likely to put more restrictions on immigration following a knife attack

The recent stabbing attack in Germany did not help the situation regarding migration. Germany is now planning to make [stricter laws](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-revise-asylum-policies-after-solingen-knife-attack/a-70074406) that simply deport and regulate what they call "irregular migration". This comes at a time when Scholz has been dealing with the issue of populism dividing German society. While Sholz represents the center-left bloc of German society, these attacks led him to meet with the conservative Christian Democrat party to discuss some of these matters. Some of the parties in his coalition were not too happy with this. This whole situation makes migration an even more pressing issue in German society. The far-right Alternative for Germany has used the situation to its advantage in getting support from this far.

### US National Parks gets a huge gift

Here is some good news for American nature lovers. The US National Park System has just received a [100 million dollar gift](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/26/nx-s1-5089844/national-park-system-100-million-dollar-grant).

The foundation has said the money would help pay for programs to enhance the park system, which includes more than 400 sites nationwide.
