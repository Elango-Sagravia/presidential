### SpaceX milestone

![](/images/spacex-launches-starship-but-fails-to-repeat-booster-catch-as-trump--1--M3Mj.webp)

SpaceX's sixth Starship test flight [demonstrated](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/science/starship-test-flight-6-launch-spacex/index.html) significant progress despite an aborted booster catch attempt. The nearly 400-foot rocket launched from Starbase, Texas, with its Super Heavy booster splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico after an automatic cancellation of the landing on the “Mechazilla” tower. President-elect Donald Trump attended, signaling a stronger [alliance](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-elon-musk-rocket-launch-3dc51e98b9cc06718839ea4116b59e33) with Elon Musk. Meanwhile, the Starship spacecraft successfully ignited its Raptor engine in space for the first time and landed in the Indian Ocean after reentry.

These tests showcased Starship's resilience under extreme conditions, indicating its readiness for future lunar and Mars missions, which is in line with [NASA’s Artemis program](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/). SpaceX is developing Starship’s upper stage as a reusable lunar lander for Artemis III, with upcoming milestones including fuel transfer tests and more extended missions.

### Biden in the Amazon

![](/images/biden-first-sitting-president-to-visit-amazon-rainforest--1--I3NT.webp)

President Joe Biden [made history](https://apnews.com/article/biden-amazon-peru-g20-3cc827382d1e3c32865a14616ddfe467) by becoming the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in the vast and vibrant Amazon rainforest. He visited Manaus, Brazil, a focal point of the Amazon's profound environmental challenges. Biden highlighted the rainforest's vital role as a significant carbon sink and its unparalleled biodiversity, underscoring its importance for Brazil and the entire planet.

This visit differs with the incoming Trump administration’s climate policy, which is expected to [scale back](https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-is-likely-to-scale-back-americas-climate-targets-will-other-countries-follow-suit-13250912) U.S. commitments. Biden’s administration has pledged substantial investments to preserve the Amazon, including a [$50 million contribution](https://timesofoman.com/article/152212-biden-announces-major-climate-initiatives-promises-additional-50-million-to-amazon-fund) to the Amazon Fund. Despite President Lula's recent successes in reducing deforestation, concerns remain over further environmental damage. This trip was part of Biden’s six-day trip to South America, during which he attended the [APEC summit](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/13/china/xi-jinping-trump-g20-apec-intl-hnk/index.html) in Peru and the [G20 Summit](https://www.reuters.com/world/g20-leaders-turn-focus-climate-change-rio-summits-last-day-2024-11-19/) in Brazil.

### The Maori fight

Thousands of Māori individuals and supporters are [protesting](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/19/why-are-new-zealands-maori-protesting-over-colonial-era-treaty-bill) against the Treaty Principles Bill introduced by the ACT Party in New Zealand. The bill seeks to redefine the principles of the [Treaty of Waitangi](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-brief), emphasizing equality among all citizens and aiming to eliminate “race-based politics.” Critics, including Māori activists, argue it undermines Māori rights and self-determination, protected in the Māori version of the Treaty.

Protests, including a significant nine-day [hikoi](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ckgrwem73gmt), have erupted. The protests also express broader discontent with government policies on Maori affairs. Although the protests are intense, the bill is unlikely to gain enough support in Parliament. There are undeniable ongoing tensions regarding Indigenous rights in New Zealand. There are significant [disparities](https://teara.govt.nz/en/ethnic-inequalities) between the Maori and other New Zealanders on an institutional level regarding health, poverty, and education.
