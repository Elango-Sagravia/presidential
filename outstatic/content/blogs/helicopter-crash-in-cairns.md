### Helicopter Crashes Into Cairns Hotel, Killing Pilot and Forcing Evacuations

A helicopter on an "unauthorized" flight crashed into the roof of the Double Tree Hotel in Cairns, Australia, early Monday morning, resulting in the pilot’s death and the evacuation of hundreds of guests. The incident occurred around 2 a.m. local time (12 p.m. Sunday ET), when the twin-engine helicopter collided with the hotel, igniting a fire. Queensland state police confirmed that the helicopter was taken without authorization, but further details have not been provided. The unidentified pilot was pronounced dead at the scene, while two hotel guests—an elderly man and a woman—were hospitalized but have since been discharged.

Rotor blades from the helicopter fell into the hotel pool, and both the forensic crash unit and Australia’s transport safety regulator are investigating the incident. Helicopter owner Nautilus Aviation is cooperating with the inquiry as authorities work to determine the cause of the crash.

Hundreds of firefighters, supported by over 30 water-dropping planes, have been battling a major forest fire near Athens, Greece, which erupted on Sunday and has intensified due to strong winds. The blaze has been fueled by exceptionally dry conditions resulting from a record-hot summer and a dry winter. It has forced the evacuation of hospitals, residential suburbs, and a children’s home. By mid-morning, the fire was burning on two fronts and was challenging to control, with flames reaching up to 80 feet high.

Authorities have deployed 670 firefighters, 27 specialized wildfire teams, and over 80 military personnel to combat the flames. They are supported by more than 180 vehicles and extensive aerial support. Early evacuations included a children’s hospital, a military hospital, two monasteries, and over a dozen residential areas, including Marathon. Local media reported that two firefighters and several civilians have been treated for smoke inhalation.

The fire has sent thick smoke over Athens, darkening the sky. Evacuation orders prompted the assistance of 380 police officers, who helped relocate over 250 people. Meteorologists have issued a red alert for wildfire hazards due to worsening conditions expected to continue through the week. Greece has faced frequent wildfires exacerbated by climate change, with significant past incidents including the 2018 Mati fire, which killed over 100 people.

### Trump’s Return to X Faces Technical Issues, Signals Growing Bond with Musk

Donald Trump’s return to X (formerly Twitter) was marred by technical difficulties and a high-profile discussion with the platform's owner, Elon Musk. During the conversation, Trump discussed his recent assassination attempt, promised the largest deportation in U.S. history, and outlined his plans to cut government regulations. The discussion, which was meant to reach millions of viewers, faced numerous delays and glitches, leading to frustration among supporters.

Despite the technical issues, the meeting underscored the evolving relationship between Trump and Musk, who have transitioned from rivals to allies. Musk, now endorsing Trump, even suggested the idea of joining a “government efficiency commission” in a potential Trump administration. This interview highlighted Trump’s re-engagement with X, where he has a larger following compared to his Truth Social platform.

The EU has urged Musk to ensure X complies with the Digital Services Act to better manage harmful content. In response, Trump’s campaign dismissed these concerns as interference in U.S. elections.

### U.S. Government Launches 'Time Is Money' Initiative to Simplify Subscriptions

The U.S. government is launching a new initiative called “Time Is Money” to simplify the process of canceling unwanted subscriptions and recurring payments. This effort includes new regulations from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which mandate easier cancellation options for consumers. The initiative also involves the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services, which are working to improve interactions between customers and health insurance providers.

As part of this initiative, the FTC has proposed a rule aimed at eliminating hidden fees associated with various services. Additionally, recent rules from the Transportation Department require airlines to provide automatic cash refunds for delays and to offer clearer fee disclosures. In a related move, the Justice Department has sued Adobe for allegedly misleading customers about cancellation fees.

Business groups have criticized the initiative, arguing that it represents excessive regulation that could potentially limit consumer options.

### U.S. Stocks End Mixed Amid Market Stabilization and Key Economic Reports

U.S. stocks ended mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 inching up by 0.01%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.2%. The market stabilized after a volatile week that saw extreme fluctuations, including a notable drop in Japanese stocks and a surge in the yen. The Bank of Japan's decision to halt further rate hikes helped calm global markets. Investors are now awaiting upcoming U.S. economic reports on inflation and retail spending, which are expected to provide further insight into the economy.

Concerns are mounting that stronger-than-expected inflation could lead to significant market declines while weakening economic data might suggest that the Federal Reserve is struggling to balance inflation control with economic growth. Bond yields fell, with the 10-year Treasury yield at 3.90% and the two-year yield at 4.01%. Nvidia's 4.1% rise helped counteract broader market losses, but Hawaiian Electric's stock plunged 14.5% due to weak results and financial concerns.

Carlos Alcaraz, the world number three and reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion, is determined to finish the season as the top-ranked player globally. Following a narrow defeat to Novak Djokovic in the Olympic final, Alcaraz is turning his attention to the Cincinnati Open, where he aims to close the 450-point gap behind world number one Jannik Sinner in the ATP live race.

Alcaraz, who was the runner-up at last year's Cincinnati Open, will begin his campaign against either Gael Monfils or Alexei Popyrin. He views the Cincinnati Open as a crucial step in his preparation for the U.S. Open, which starts on August 26. Notably, Djokovic, who recently claimed victory at the Olympics, has withdrawn from the Cincinnati tournament, potentially opening up opportunities for other contenders.
