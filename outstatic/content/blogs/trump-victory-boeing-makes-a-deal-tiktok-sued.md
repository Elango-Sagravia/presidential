### Election results

Donald Trump has [secured the keys](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-trump-harris-11-06-24/index.html) to the white house. He has taken Wisconsin and Pennslyvania, which were the two states that made up the “blue wall” that Harris would have needed to secure the white house. The votes from the three key swing states—Arizona, Nevada, and Michigan—are still being counted, and while there could be a recount, even so, Trump is the winner of the 2024 US Presidential Election. He is the first politician since the late [1800s](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/11/02/grover-cleveland-the-only-former-us-president-to-make-a-successful-comeback_6731366_4.html) to lose re-election and later mount a successful run.

In other election developments, the Senate has [flipped](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/republicans-flip-the-us-senate-ending-two-years-of-democrat-control) to having a Republican majority after 3 years of Democrat control. They secured 51 seats, and several more are pending. Four U.S. states moved to [safeguard](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/05/politics/abortion-state-ballot-measure-dg/index.html) access to abortion, bolstering protections amid ongoing national debates. Meanwhile, in Florida, an effort to expand abortion rights faced a setback, with a proposed constitutional amendment for November still pending.

### Boeing deal

After nearly two months of strike action, Boeing workers have voted to [accept a new contract](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mz9ml473mo), effectively concluding what is recognized as the most expensive labor strike in the United States in the past quarter-century. This agreement includes a 43% pay increase spread over the next four years, aiming to enhance the financial stability of the workforce. Workers will receive a one-time $12,000 bonus for immediate financial relief. However, the contract has been criticized for not reinstating the traditional pension plan, which employees see as essential for retirement security.

The strike significantly impacted Boeing, its suppliers, and dependent airlines, causing an estimated loss of [$6.5 billion](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/01/business/boeing-strike-deal-new-vote/index.html). In response, Boeing's CEO highlighted the importance of rebuilding trust with the workforce and addressing production backlogs for a swift recovery, emphasizing that restoring relationships and improving efficiency are vital for the company's future.

### TikTok taken to court

In France, seven families are [suing](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6298z99xv8o) TikTok, claiming that the platform's algorithm exposed their children to harmful content, which they allege contributed to severe mental health issues and, in two cases, led to suicide. This lawsuit, filed in the Creteil judicial court, marks the first legal action of its kind in Europe and seeks to hold TikTok accountable for failing to protect young users.

TikTok has stated that it has not yet received any notifications regarding the lawsuit and emphasized its commitment to combating harmful content through both technology and human moderators. This case adds to the growing global concern over the impact of social media on adolescent [mental health](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-media-teens-mental-health).
