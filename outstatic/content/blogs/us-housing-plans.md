### Harris and Trump Clash Over Housing Solutions

Housing has recently gained prominence in the presidential race, with Vice President Kamala Harris unveiling a plan to aid renters, target corporate landlords, and build 3 million new homes. Both Harris and former President Donald Trump are addressing the affordability crisis, but they face the challenge of balancing affordable housing with wealth generation.

Chen Zhao of Redfin points out that increasing supply is crucial, but local zoning rules and rising prices complicate the issue. Despite easing mortgage rates, high rents and a significant housing shortage continue to burden renters.

Harris has proposed $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time buyers, while Trump’s platform focuses on promoting homeownership through tax incentives. This shift toward addressing lower-income needs reflects the severity of the housing crisis, with Democrats especially prioritizing this issue.

Trump's suggestions to restrict immigration and impose higher tariffs to reduce housing costs are controversial. Economists argue these measures could increase housing costs by limiting the construction workforce and raising material prices, complicating efforts to address the housing shortage.

### Experts Monitor U.S. Risk from Mpox Clade I

Concerns about a more severe subtype of mpox, known as clade I, spreading across Africa have prompted the World Health Organization to reclassify the virus as a public health emergency. Despite clade I’s increased transmissibility and severity compared to clade II, experts believe the U.S. risk is mitigated by existing immunity from past infections and vaccinations.

There have been no U.S. cases of clade I reported so far, and experts suggest that high-quality healthcare could minimize potential impacts. The CDC continues to monitor and prepare for any cases that may arise, emphasizing vigilance and the efficacy of vaccines against both clades.

### Sudanese Paramilitary Attack Leaves 85 Dead

Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a brutal attack on the village of Galgani in central Sennar province, killing at least 85 people, including women and children, and wounding over 150. The RSF fighters looted, burned, and assaulted villagers in the latest atrocity of Sudan’s ongoing conflict.

The assault occurred after villagers resisted earlier RSF attempts to abduct and assault women. The RSF’s actions follow a pattern of violence and human rights abuses since the conflict began in April last year. The RSF has been widely condemned for similar atrocities throughout Sudan.

### Southern Africa Faces Severe El Niño Drought

Nearly 70 million people in southern Africa are suffering from a severe drought induced by El Niño, leading to widespread food shortages and extreme measures, including eating grass seed. The crisis has prompted Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, and Namibia to declare states of disaster and call for humanitarian aid.

Malawi is facing an especially dire situation, with about 9 million people, including many children, in need of assistance due to the worst drought in over a century. The drought has devastated crops, forcing people like farmer Masautso Mwale to cut down trees for charcoal to feed their families, despite the environmental harm.

Heads of state from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have highlighted the long-term impacts of the drought, which has worsened economies and food security across the region. A $5.5 billion aid appeal has seen insufficient funding, and concerns grow about the future as greenhouse gas emissions potentially increase the frequency and severity of El Niño events.

### Kasia Niewiadoma Wins Women’s Tour de France by 4 Seconds

Polish rider Kasia Niewiadoma secured her first Women’s Tour de France title with a razor-thin victory over Demi Vollering, winning by just four seconds. The win, achieved after a dramatic final climb on Alpe d’Huez, marks the smallest margin of victory in Tour history, including the men’s race. Niewiadoma finished fourth in the stage, with an overall time of 24 hours, 36 minutes, and 7 seconds, while Vollering, who won the stage, finished with a total time of 24:36:11.

Exhausted and overwhelmed, Niewiadoma celebrated after confirming her victory. She described the Tour as a "crazy roller-coaster" and was visibly moved as she lifted her bike in triumph. Despite Vollering's strong final stretch, the gap was not enough to overcome Niewiadoma’s lead.
