He was supposed to be traveling to Baku in his private jet. The offenses related to his app involve some charges ranging from fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organized crime, and the promotion of terrorism. On Sunday, the Russian Embassy in Paris said the French authorities were "refusing to cooperate" after Durov's arrest. Telegram has increased in popularity and is expected to reach a billion users this year.

The two were initially expected to be at the International Space Station for eight days. But they have been there for quite a bit longer than planned, thanks to some problems with the Boeing Starliner. They have been stranded since June. SpaceX's Crew-9 mission is scheduled for late September. It will launch with only two passengers instead of the expected four. The plan is to dock the vehicle at the ISS until February and return with the passengers plus the stranded four.

French police have arrested over an [arson attack on a synagogue](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240825-french-police-arrest-suspect-over-fire-attack-on-synagogue) in Southern France. The arrest happened after a shootout with the suspect. Nobody was killed or harmed. The suspect faces some injuries. Also, a policeman had some injuries from an exploding gas bottle the suspect used for the fire. The suspect is a 33-year-old Algerian national. Anti-Semitic attacks have been on the rise in France this year over Israel’s retaliation in Gaza following the attacks on October 7th. Police protection of synagogues, Jewish schools, and businesses will be stepped up across France.

### **German police arrest suspect from stabbing attack**

Police arrested the stabbing in the Western German city of Solingen on Friday evening that killed three people and wounded eight others. Isis has come out to take responsibility for the stabbing. They stated that the attacker targeted Christians, 'to avenge Muslims in Palestine and everywhere. The suspect is a 26-year-old Syrian who moved to Germany two years ago. Similarly to France, Germany has seen a rise of extremism following the Israel-Gaza from many different elements to society. There is a rise in attacks against Muslims from the far right as well. This incident won't be of any help.

### **Postcard arrives correct destination 121 years later**

A postcard in the UK arrived at its final destination over a century too late. The Christmas themes postcard is from 1903; it was mailed to the address for the Swansea Building Society’s Cradock Street branch. Surprisingly, this branch still exists, but not the original recipient, Miss Lydia Davis. The staff members use social media to find Lydia's relatives or descendants. She was 16 in 1903. The postcard was more likely to be intercepted, remain idle somewhere, and then recently put back in the post by someone rather than [lost in the postal service for 121 years](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/postcard-finally-arrives-in-swansea-121-years-after-it-was-first-sent-quest-to-find-descendants-begins/). This will be an incredible find for someone if it gets into the right hands.

**Kamala Harris soars higher in the polls**

Putting a new front-runner on the Democratic ticket has paid off. Kamala [Harris is ahead in many national polls](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4846433-harris-leading-trump-by-7-points-poll/) by 7 percent. Polls have also put her ahead in many of the critical swing states. This is a significant change from the polls in the months leading to Biden’s decision not to run in November.  The biggest challenge the Harris campaign has is to appeal to Arab American progressive contingent who have been critical of the Biden-Harris Administration's stance towards Gaza. She also has some challenges with more moderate voters who might lean right. However, picking Tim Waltz has boosted support from “ Middle America” to help her campaign further.

**Hungary turns back on Ukrainian refugees (and others)**

Ukrainian refugees have found themselves homeless in Hungary this week. In June, Viktor Orban signed a decree that cut state support for some Ukrainian refugees in the country. Now that the decree has come into effect, [3,000 Ukrainian refugees are at risk](https://www.dw.com/en/hungarys-government-makes-ukrainian-refugees-homeless/a-70026664) of being homeless. The decree only gives Ukrainians front the actual combat area support; the rest of them lose it, particularly the Romani refugees from Western UkrainianHowever, the Hungarian government has not only been strict towards Ukrainian refugees.  A Hungarian politician said this week that he will give all migrants a free one-way ticket to Brussels. There has been criticism of Central European countries for being selectively empathetic towards Ukrainian Refugees compared to others. But Hungary is consistent.
