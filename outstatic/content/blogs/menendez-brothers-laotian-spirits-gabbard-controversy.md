### Menendez brothers

![](/images/the-menendez-brothers-are-set-to-appear-in-court-for-the-first-time-in-28-years-E3NT.jpg)

Erik and Lyle Menendez [attended](https://abcnews.go.com/US/menendez-brothers-case-back-court-hearing-petition-review/story?id=116127153) a court hearing regarding their habeas corpus petition, which cites new [evidence](https://www.euronews.com/2024/11/25/judge-to-decide-if-new-evidence-could-set-menendez-brothers-free) of abuse by their father, Jose Menendez. The petition includes testimony from a former Menudo member and a letter from Erik to his cousin, revealing abuse that was not available during their 1996 trial.

Two [paths](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/menendez-brothers-free-resentencing-rcna181428) for their potential release are being explored: outgoing Los Angeles DA George Gascón recommended resentencing for parole eligibility, while DA-elect Nathan Hochman plans a full review. The brothers also seek clemency from Governor Gavin Newsom, pending Hochman’s assessment. The next court hearing is set for December 11. The View hosts discussed the case, emphasizing the broader issue of abuse awareness, with [Whoopi Goldberg](https://www.newsweek.com/whoopi-goldberg-view-cases-reviewed-menendez-brothers-released-1991378) noting, “This conversation is bigger than just the Menendez brothers.”

### Laos methanol spirits

![](/images/-don-t-drink-the-spirits--story--laos-methanol-deaths-AxMz.jpg)

Six tourists died in Vang Vieng, Laos, from [suspected methanol poisoning](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c624kd71dj3o) in alcohol, sparking fear among backpackers. The victims, five young women and a 57-year-old American man, all stayed at the Nana Backpackers hostel, now closed amid investigations. Methanol, a toxic chemical sometimes found in unregulated alcohol, is believed to have caused the deaths.

Vang Vieng, famous for “tubing” and a [lively backpacker scene](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/22/travel/laos-methanol-deaths-vang-vieng-intl-hnk/index.html), remains busy, though tourists avoid spirits and stick to bottled drinks. Despite concerns, many travelers continue visiting and taking precautions. The tragedy highlights safety risks in popular tourist spots. Once a quiet town, Vang Vieng has transformed into a booming tourist hub, balancing luxury developments with its free-spirited charm. Stricter oversight may follow, but the town’s tourism scene grapples with the shock for now.

### Gabbard controversy

Donald Trump’s pick to lead the [intelligence community](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/22/politics/tulsi-gabbard-government-watch-list-travel-connections/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc), Tulsi Gabbard, was briefly placed on the TSA’s [“Quiet Skies”](https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2018/08/22/facts-about-quiet-skies) list, triggering additional security screening before flights. This occurred because her overseas travel and foreign connections raised red flags in a government algorithm. Although Gabbard claimed her placement was linked to her criticism of Kamala Harris, two sources disputed this.

The Quiet Skies program is a risk-based screening tool, not a terrorist watchlist. Gabbard’s inclusion has led to [increased scrutiny](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tulsi-gabbard-trumps-intelligence-pick-set-to-face-tough-questions-7099454) of her foreign policy history. As a former Democratic representative from Hawaii who switched parties, her meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and her controversial statements on Russia are likely to be focal points during her confirmation hearings.
