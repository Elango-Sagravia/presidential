### US Commemorates 9-11 Anniversary

On Wednesday, the U.S. observed the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. There was a [memorial service](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-attend-911-ceremony-hours-first-debate-rcna170494) in New York City at ground zero at 8:30 am, close to the time when the actual attack happened. Harris and Biden traveled to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the site of the Flight 93 memorial.

Harris and Biden were not the only ones attending the memorial at Ground Zero. Vance and Trump were also at the scene. Harris and Trump shook hands at the memorial just a few hours after their dramatic debate. However, in the end, regardless of which side of the aisle one is on, this is not an event that brings up partisan issues.

### Russian Birthrate at a Low Point

Russia’s birthrate has fallen to a historic low in the last 25 years, and the Kremlin isn’t happy with this finding. The population has also had an 18% decline, with more deaths recorded. The head of the State Duma Committee for Family Protection said a "special demographic operation" was needed in Russia to stimulate the birth rate. The [“special operation”](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/10/russias-birth-rate-drops-to-its-lowest-in-a-quarter-century-data-shows) part refers to the war in Ukraine.

The war in Ukraine is one of the significant factors in the decline. The number of conscripts being killed contributed to the increase. Many young people are also leaving the country. Russia offers financial incentives to families, but security aspects of the war have made procreation less desirable, according to a risk analyst.

### UK to Require a Visa Waiver for US and EU Citizens

Travelers who want to go to the UK without a visa will soon be required to pay a $13 fee and apply online for an [electronic travel authorization](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/10/travel/european-travelers-uk-entry-fee-eta/index.html). It is now only for a handful of nationalities but will apply to US citizens in November and European citizens in the spring of 2025. Irish citizens are exempt.

The UK is joining countries like the US and Canada, which have a similar visa waiver system. The European Union is expected to have a similar program in 2025. While it may look like a hassle, it is still less hassle than applying for an actual UK visa, which is a reality for those with weaker passports.

The Spanish police have made their biggest [drug bust](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/10/spanish-police-confiscate-more-than-1-million-ecstasy-pills) in history. They managed to take over 25 million euros of drugs. The most notable being a million ecstasy pills. They found a bunch of other party drugs, such as 20 kilos of cocaine, 73 kilos of MDMA, and 212 kilos of ketamine.

No, they didn’t get this in one bust. It was part of a big sting called “Operation Adriatic." It was taken from 8 searches in both Ibiza and Malaga. However, it is connected to the same organization. Nine suspects were arrested in connection with this. Spain has had a series of drug busts this year. They recently found 1,000 cannabis plants last month.

### Melbourne Protests Result in the Arrest of 40

Anti-war protesters and police had a major brawl outside a [defense exhibition](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/anti-war-protesters-police-clash-outside-melbourne-defence-expo-2024-09-10/) in Melbourne, Australia. The police arrested dozens of the protestors. The protestors were throwing rocks, horse manure, and bottles filled with liquid at the police and attendees. They also tried to set fires and block attendees from the venue. The police used sponge grenades, flash-bang devices, and irritant sprays to de-escalate.

Both the police and the protestors accused the other of being violent. The event protested was the Land Forces International Land Defence Exposition, Australia’s largest expo. Over 1,200 protestors showed up. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was okay with people protesting, but they must do it peacefully.
