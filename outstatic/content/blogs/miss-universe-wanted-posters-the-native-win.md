### Miss Universe

Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark [made history](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/16/style/miss-universe-2024-winner-denmark-intl-hnk/index.html) as the first Dane to win Miss Universe at the 2024 competition in Mexico City. The 21-year-old competitive dancer and aspiring lawyer triumphed over 120 contestants, accepting the crown from 2023 winner Sheynnis Palacios. Theilvig impressed judges with her confidence and encouraging message to "keep fighting. The first runner-up was Chidimma Adetshina of Nigeria, who was in the news earlier. Her entrance caused a Nigeria- South African [Row](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/9/17/how-a-beauty-queen-became-the-face-of-south-africa-nigeria-tensions) as she is also a South African citizen. Her entry opened a lot of emotions for those in South Africa with a Nigerian background. 

This year’s contest tried to modernize more by removing age and marital restrictions, welcoming contestants from countries like Cuba and Eritrea for the first time. The 73rd Miss Universe highlighted resilience and inclusivity amidst ongoing [controversies](https://wspartners.bbc.com/episode/w3ct67gd) in some national pageants and debates about whether or not these [pageants](https://medium.com/change-becomes-you/in-an-already-sexist-world-do-we-really-need-beauty-pageants-b25706a59f1d) should become a thing of the past. 

### Antisemitism on campus

![](/images/hundreds-of--wanted--posters-were-plastered-across-the-university-of-rochester-campus-I0Mz.jpg)

The University of Rochester is [investigating](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/university-rochester-wanted-posters) after “wanted” posters targeting faculty, staff, and administrators, including members of the Jewish community, were discovered on campus Sunday night. University President Sarah Mangelsdorf condemned the posters as antisemitic, divisive, and intimidating, noting that they precisely targeted some individuals for their Jewish identity. The posters accused the featured individuals of supporting Israel’s Gaza offensive and actions such as “ethnic cleansing” and the “displacement of Palestinians.”

Pro-Palestinian advocates, including Jewish Voice for Peace, challenged the university's stance, stating the posters criticized institutional collaboration in the Gaza conflict and included non-Jews. While many of the support Palestine isn’t anti-semitic, some actions blur the line between advocacy and antisemitism, which is rising across the political spectrum in the U.S. Recently, a group of masked individuals [waving Nazi flags](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/us/michigan-nazi-flags-anne-frank-theater/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc) protested outside a theater production of The Diary of Anne Frank in Howell, Michigan, engaging in antisemitic and racist behavior, leaving attendees feeling threatened. This incident was linked to far-right groups.

### Native names

California will [remove](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/16/nx-s1-5193831/derogatory-native-indigenous-women-removed-california) the derogatory term “squaw” from over 30 geographic features across the state by 2025, as announced by the California Natural Resources Agency on Friday. The term, which has historically been used as an ethnic, racial, and sexist slur against Native American women, will be erased from places such as streets, bridges, cemeteries, and even a forest fire fuel break.

This action follows a law passed in [2022](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-25/new-law-will-remove-the-word-squaw-from-california-place-names), which requires the removal of the term from all geographic locations in California. A commission will intervene with recommendations if local governments fail to develop new names for these sites by January 1, 2025. Some places have already started the renaming process, particularly a popular Lake Tahoe [ski resort](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/lake-tahoe-california-resort-offensive-name-changed/index.html#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20Palisades%20Tahoe%20is,term%20against%20Native%20American%20women.), and the city of West Sacramento replaced the term with the word used in street names with  “Tebti,” recommended by the local Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation.
