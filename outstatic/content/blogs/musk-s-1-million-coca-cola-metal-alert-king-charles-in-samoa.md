### THE BIG ONE

### Muskâ€™s Million Dollar Deal

![Elon Muskâ€™s America PAC offers $1 million daily to a Pennsylvania voter for Trump support](/images/musk-s-million-dollar-game--1--Y2MD.jpg)

Elon Musk recently unveiled an initiative to distribute [$1 million](https://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk-offers-1m-daily-prize-to-voters-who-sign-petition/a-70546787) daily to a randomly selected registered voter in Pennsylvania until the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The intention is to gather support for Donald Trump. Muskâ€™s campaign group, [America PAC](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/america-pac/), is behind the initiative. It draws from individuals who sign a petition advocating for constitutional rights, mainly free speech and the right to bear arms.

Previously, Musk offered an incentive of [$100 to every voter](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-offers-pennsylvania-voters-100-sign-donald-trump-petition-presidential-election-1971021) who joined the petition. The initiative is crafted to motivate Trump supporters in crucial swing states, where their votes might significantly influence the election outcome. Musk has given [$75 million to Trumpâ€™s campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/g-s1-28591/elon-musk-donald-trump-america-pac-fec) and hopes to rally over a million supporters.

The initiative has been met with substantial backlash. Legal concerns are being raised, as federal law explicitly prohibits financial incentives for voting. While Musk's payments are directed at individuals signing a petition rather than directly for their votes, [legal experts](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/20/us-election-legal-experts-question-elon-musks-planned-cash-giveaways) still call some of this into question.

### RECAP

### Coca-Cola Metal Alert

Coca-Cola has recalled 28 million half-liter plastic bottles in Austria after discovering a potential [risk of metal contamination](https://www.dw.com/en/coca-cola-recalls-28-million-bottles-in-austria/a-70591283) due to a production issue. The recall includes specific batches of Coke, Fanta, Sprite, and MezzoMix with best-before dates between February and April 2025. Consumers are advised to return the affected products for a refund, even without a receipt. Austrian authorities and retailers are monitoring the recall closely to ensure customer safety.

### King Charles in Samoa

King Charles III visited Samoa, marking his first visit. He was warmly welcomed in a traditional [Samoan Ava ceremony](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/24/king-charles-samoa-tour-visit-welcome-ceremony-apia-kava) held in Apia. During the ceremony, Charles participated in rituals involving kava, a traditional drink, and was honored with a Samoan chiefly title [(see photos)](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1243423-buckingham-palace-releases-colourful-photos-from-king-charles-samoa-tour). This visit, part of a broader tour of the Pacific, focuses on strengthening relationships with the region, emphasizing issues such as climate resilience and sustainable development.

### Menendez Brothers Parole

Los Angeles County District Attorney George GascÃ³n announced plans to [recommend resentencing](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/24/us/menendez-brothers-case-trial-now/index.html) for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents. This would make the brothers eligible for immediate parole, following new evidence and reconsideration of potential abuse claims from their defense. GascÃ³n believes the resentencing will allow the parole board to assess if their debt to society has been fulfilled and, if so, approve their release. See a timeline of the Menendez case [here](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/06/us/menendez-brothers-timeline/index.html) (warningâ€”sensitive).
