### Execution in Iran

![Iran’s execution of Jamshid Sharmahd prompts German condemnation over human rights concerns](/images/german-iranian-executed-in-iran-E5OT.jpg)

Iran has [executed](https://www.dw.com/en/iran-executes-german-iranian-jamshid-sharmahd/a-70622205) Jamshid Sharmahd, a dual citizen of Germany and Iran, following his conviction on charges over his alleged involvement in a deadly bombing at a mosque in [2008](https://jamestown.org/brief/iranian-monarchist-group-claims-responsibility-for-shiraz-mosque-attack/) that resulted in multiple casualties. The execution has sparked outrage among German officials who have publicly condemned the action. They criticized the Iranian legal proceedings, highlighting the absence of a fair and impartial trial, which they believe is a fundamental human rights violation.

Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, say Sharmahd’s trial was “[grossly unfair](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/6642/2023/en/).” They have raised concerns about the [alleged coercion](https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/iran/iran-new-report-demands-end-to-the-rampant-use-of-forced-confessions) behind his confessions, suggesting that they were obtained under duress, undermining the integrity of the judicial process. In light of these developments, there is [pressure](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/29/could-berlin-have-saved-jamshid-sharmahd-from-execution-in-iran) within Germany for the government to take decisive diplomatic measures in response to Iran’s actions. Calls for a stronger stance against Iran are increasing, as many feel that the situation not only affects bilateral relations. Germany [summoned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/berlin-summons-iran-ambassador-over-execution-of-german-iranian-jamshid-sharmahd) the Iranian ambassador on Tuesday.

### Delhi air crisis

![Delhi's air quality reaches 'severe' levels due to Diwali firecrackers and crop burning](/images/dehli-air-pollution-worsens-cwMj.jpg)

Air quality in Delhi is surging to [alarming levels](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l99lzz8lwo), with pollution exceeding World Health Organization limits by 25 to 30 times. The factors to explain this are the use of firecrackers during [Diwali](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/diwali-2024-firecracker-ban-in-9-states-including-delhi-and-maharashtra-mumbai-says-no-to-sky-lanterns-bengaluru-11730174017863.html) and crop burning in neighboring states. Recent measurements show PM 2.5 levels at 350 micrograms per cubic meter, categorizing the air quality as "severe" and posing significant health risks. In response, local authorities have implemented various measures, including a ban on fireworks and introducing the [Graded Response Action Plan](https://indianexpress.com/article/upsc-current-affairs/upsc-essentials/knowledge-nugget-of-the-day-graded-response-action-plan-grap-9628150/#:~:text=Graded%20Response%20Action%20Plan%20\(GRAP\)%20is%20a%20set%20of%20emergency,category%20\(201%20to%20300\).%5C) designed to tackle air pollution systematically.

However, enforcing compliance with these regulations is challenging, as many residents continue to engage in activities that contribute to pollution. Health experts and officials urge residents to stay indoors during peak pollution hours and use public transportation to reduce emissions. The situation stresses the need for collective action to tackle air pollution and protect public health in the capital. Air quality across [South Asia](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/global-widening-impact-of-climate-change-on-air-pollution-in-south-asia-requires-urgent-international-cooperation-and-assistance/#:~:text=Air%20quality%20in%20South%20Asia,the%20worst%20air%20quality%20globally.) is critically poor, with 29 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

### Philadelphia on Mask’s PAC

Philadelphia’s District Attorney, Larry Krasner, is taking a stand by filing a [lawsuit](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg78ljxn8g7o) to block Elon Musk’s America PAC from launching a $1 million giveaway linked to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign [(see write-up)](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/berlin-attack-foiled-cuba-blackout-musk-s-million-dollar-move). Krasner argues that America PAC is violating Pennsylvania laws against illegal lotteries. The lawsuit argues the promotion is misleading and lacks necessary transparency, particularly regarding the odds of winning and how winners are chosen.

Critics find this troubling as participants must support specific constitutional amendments to enter the contest. This condition has sparked debates about potential [vote-buying](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/24/elon-musk-pay-1-million-daily-voters-trump/75822067007/), with some suggesting it exploits people’s financial contributions to advance political goals. President Biden says the initiative is “[totally inappropriate](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-elon-musk-voter-giveaway-1976174).” The lawsuit and the surrounding issues highlight growing worries about the connection between money and politics, especially with elections on the horizon.
