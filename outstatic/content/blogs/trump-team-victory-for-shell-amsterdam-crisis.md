### The Trump team

Just one week after the election, Donald Trump is already at it when picking his prominent staff members. He is poised to choose Florida Senator [Mark Rubio](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5187110/donald-trump-marco-rubio-secretary-of-state) as secretary of state. The expected nomination of Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State marks a significant shift in the Trump administration’s foreign policy team. If confirmed, He would have a strong voice in U.S. foreign relations in the administration. Rubio’s approach to foreign policy tends to be more traditionally hawkish, advocating for a strong U.S. presence abroad.

For other appointments, Trump is preparing to appoint Florida Rep. [Michael Waltz](https://www.newsweek.com/mike-waltz-china-hawk-trump-national-security-adviser-1984130) as his national security adviser, according to two sources. Waltz, a former Green Beret and a longstanding Trump ally has been a vocal advocate for strengthening U.S. defenses, focusing on countering threats from China and ensuring NATO allies increase their defense spending. Trump seems to be building his team of [loyalists](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/trump-team-loyalists-analysis/index.html). He also announced Tuesday that billionaire backer [Elon Musk](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/11/12/trumps-cabinet-here-are-his-picks-for-key-roles-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-pete-hegseth-and-more/) and supporter Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency.”

### Shell climate

![Shell wins appeal against ruling to cut emissions 45% by 2030](/images/shell-wins-appeal-against-order-to-cut-emissions-E2Mj.webp)

Shell [won its appeal](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-wins-appeal-against-landmark-dutch-climate-ruling-2024-11-12/) against a 2021 ruling that ordered it to cut carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, a victory over one of the highest-profile climate lawsuits. While the Hague appeals court upheld Shell’s duty to reduce emissions, it agreed that courts shouldn’t dictate specific targets, leaving that responsibility to governments. [Friends of the Earth Netherlands](https://www.foei.org/member-groups/netherlands/) filed the original case and voiced disappointment, but they noted that the trial reinforced that big polluters aren’t “above the law.”

Shell CEO Wael Sawan welcomed the decision, seeing it as beneficial for Shell and the global energy transition. Following shifts in global energy demands, Shell has scaled back on some renewable efforts but plans to invest $10-15 billion in [low-carbon energy](https://www.shell.com/business-customers/shell-low-carbon-solutions.html). Analysts view the decision as empowering Shell’s climate strategy autonomy.

### Amsterdam tram

![](/images/dutch-tram-set-on-fire-in-new-amsterdam-unrest--1--E0OT.jpg)

In Amsterdam, a group armed with sticks and firecrackers set a tram [ablaze](https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-tram-set-on-fire-in-new-amsterdam-unrest/a-70759392) at the ’40-’45 Square on Monday, shattering its windows, though the tram was empty and no one was hurt. Police quickly extinguished the fire, dispersed the crowd, and made several arrests. This incident follows escalating tensions after Israeli football fans [clashed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/11/what-happened-amsterdam-israeli-football-fans) with locals during a match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax Amsterdam.

Five more people were detained on Monday for alleged involvement in those earlier attacks. The violence drew sharp criticism from Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, who condemned the attacks as “antisemitic.” Some of the protestors physically beat groups of Tel Aviv supporters. Amsterdam has since imposed a temporary ban on pro-Palestinian protests in response to the unrest. Many believe it is unfair and pointed to some unsavory actions by [Tel Aviv supporters](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/8/israeli-football-fans-clash-with-protesters-in-amsterdam) who shouted anti-Arab slurs and tore down Palestinian flags.
