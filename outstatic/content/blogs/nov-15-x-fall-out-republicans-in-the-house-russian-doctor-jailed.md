### The X exodus

![Post-election user decline on X as frustrated users migrate to Bluesky and Threads, citing bots, harassment, and AI content terms](/images/the-guardian-quits-x-U2Mj.webp)

After the recent U.S. presidential election, social media platform X (formerly Twitter) saw a [significant user drop](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/x-sees-largest-user-exodus-musk-takeover-rcna179793) as people flocked to alternative platforms like Bluesky and Threads, citing issues with increased bots, harassment, and partisan ads under Elon Musk’s leadership. Many users, such as Taylor Swift fans, activists, and professionals, were left frustrated with the platform’s atmosphere.

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), now the top free app on Apple’s App Store, recently gained over a million users in just a week. Meanwhile, X announced [new terms](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/21/tech/x-twitter-terms-of-service/index.html) allowing user content for AI training, spurring more users to delete posts or accounts. The exodus has led some to weigh the balance between keeping their X presence or fully committing to other platforms.

### Republicans take over

![Republicans retain House control as Trump returns, with Speaker Mike Johnson facing challenges in advancing key policies](/images/us_-republicans-win-house-U4Mj.webp)

Republicans have [retained control](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4974235-house-republicans-control-majority/) of the House, granting the GOP unified power in Washington as President-elect Trump returns to office. Decision Desk HQ confirmed the House GOP’s majority after key victories, despite some setbacks among New York Republicans. Speaker [Mike Johnso](https://www.shreveportbossieradvocate.com/news/heres-what-speaker-mike-johnson-had-to-say-following-u-s-house-leadership-elections/article_9d436ef6-a1ea-11ef-92ba-ebe0f1655fea.html), whose leadership rose rapidly, received Trump’s praise and is expected to continue in the Speaker role if he garners full GOP support in January.

Johnson and top Republicans have outlined plans to revive Trump-era policies on taxes, immigration, and education, but narrow margins and intraparty divides could challenge their agenda. The GOP’s success denies Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries the chance to become the first Black House Speaker. Republicans are now working to influence necessary [legislative actions](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4981773-republican-agenda-trump-congress) before the new Congress starts.

### Silenced in Russia

Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, a Russian pediatrician, was [sentenced](https://www.euronews.com/2024/11/13/doctor-who-criticised-war-in-ukraine-sentenced-to-five-years-in-russian-prison) to five and a half years in prison on charges of spreading false information about the Russian military. Her arrest followed a complaint by Anastasia Akinshina, a mother who claimed that during a pediatric session, Buyanova criticized Russia’s actions in Ukraine and implied that Akinshina’s late husband, a soldier, was a legitimate target for Ukrainian forces. Buyanova denied the allegations, and her defense argued that no recording or substantial evidence supported the claims, suggesting that the mother’s statement might have stemmed from her personal views on Ukraine.

The high-profile case has sparked a public outcry in Russia, with more than 6,500 people signing a petition demanding Buyanova’s release. Her sentence comes amid Russia’s stringent [2022 laws](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/07/russia-criminalizes-independent-war-reporting-anti-war-protests) criminalizing anti-war speech, with over 1,000 people facing similar charges. Rights groups, such as OVD-info, have highlighted Buyanova’s case as an example of increasing repression of dissent in Russia.
