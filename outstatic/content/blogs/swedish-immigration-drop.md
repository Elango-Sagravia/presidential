### Swedish immigration reaches historic lows

For the first time in many years, the number of [Swedes leaving Sweden](https://www.dw.com/en/sweden-sees-drop-in-immigration-as-more-people-leave/a-69954145) is higher than that of people immigrating to Sweden. In early August, the Swedish Office of Statistics reported that 5,700 more people had emigrated than immigrated from January to May 2024. Some factors are related to the change in the Swedish government from 2022. The minority government is backed by the Swedish far right. The restrictions have become much more complicated. Another underlying factor is the influx of migrants from countries like Syria, Somalia, and Iraq, who are voluntarily leaving. The motivations for leaving remain mixed, but the most common is dissatisfaction with Sweden.

### Doctor Strike in India continues

Doctors across India have been on [strike](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/18/some-doctors-still-on-strike-protests-spread-after-indian-medics-murder). This started with the recent rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor in a state-run hospital in Kolkata. Doctors and other healthcare workers have led the protests but are joined by thousands of other Indian citizens demanding justice. The city police are accused of mishandling the case. Many laws have been put in tact recently in India to punish rapists and protect women; however, many have said they are not enough. The strike ended on Sunday morning, but the Indian Medical Association gave a 72-hour deadline for authorities to conduct a proper inquiry and make arrests, or they would continue to strike.

### Taliban enters its 4th year

The Taliban recently celebrated the 3rd anniversary of their [takeover of Afghanistan](https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-takeover-timeline-df3df916cae4b07d53a302dc9a2811d8). August 15th marks the day when the Taliban march into Kabul as internationally backed President Ashraf Ghani flees the country. Three years later, they are still running the show. They have little in the way. The international community remains divided on whether or not to have relations with the Taliban. This year, Kabul now receives flights from AirArabia, Fly Dubai, and Turkish Airlines. They attended their first UN-backed meeting earlier this summer, which sparked much international outrage, particularly over women and civil society being excluded.

### Lebanon deals with nationwide power outages

Lebanon's leading power company announced last Saturday a new [nationwide power outage](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240818-lebanon-faces-nationwide-power-outage-after-last-production-unit-shuts-down/). This outage affected Beirut’s international airport, the main port of Beirut, the prisons, and many wastewater plants. Over the past couple of years, the frequency of power outages in Lebanon has significantly increased due to the government’s financial problems. The recent war between Israel and Hezbollah has worsened the situation. Lebanon’s power production was at 1,600 and 2,000 megawatts daily, but production continues to decrease to extremely low levels.

### Libya’s Central Bank Shuts Down

[Libya shut down its Central Bank](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/libyas-central-bank-suspends-operations-after-kidnapping-official-2024-08-18/) on Sunday. The reason for this shutdown is one of their employees and the head of information technology, Musab Msallemwas kidnapped by an unidentified group from his house this morning. They said they will cease operations until he is returned. This kidnapping comes a week after a gunman seized their bank. The attackers for both are demanding the resignation of the bank's governor, Seddik al-Kabir. He has been criticized for mismanaging oil resources and the state budget. The central bank is a vital economic income source for the country, which is presently in a civil war between the UN-recognized government and the rival government in the east of the country.

### Turkish tourist hotspot deals with wildfires

Turkey has suffered [130 wildfires in its Mugla region](https://www.euronews.com/video/2024/08/19/hundreds-mobilised-as-fires-spread-in-turkeys-tourist-hotspot-mugla) this week. They are still battling five as of Monday afternoon. Thousands have been evacuated, and 300 personnel are dealing with it. Low humidity, high temperatures, and windy conditions have been the factors for these fires. During its peak season, Mugla receives many tourists from Europe and Russia yearly. In addition to the damage these fires cause, this year’s tourist season is severely affected. Luckily, no casualties have been reported so far. Authorities have warned people against making outdoor fires and have put the whole region on alert.

### Protests Erupt at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago

The Democratic National Convention kicked off on Monday Night in Chicago, just shy of a month after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Kamala. Kamala Harris is expected to officially accept the nomination for president. Not everyone is happy about it. Chicago had a series of demonstrations, mainly about the situation in Gaza. [Thousands of protestors](https://apnews.com/article/protest-democratic-convention-chicago-war-87d32321eb5714e2005fe8410b928513) are demanding a ceasefire and pressuring democratic leadership to be more proactive towards Gaza. Many people can’t help but wonder if this will be a repeat of the 1968 convention, which had many Vietnam protestors clash with the police. It also happened to be in Chicago. So far, this hasn’t happened, but there are three days to go.
