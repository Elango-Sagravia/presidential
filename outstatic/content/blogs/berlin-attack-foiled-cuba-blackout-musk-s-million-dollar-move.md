### Berlin Embassy Plot Foiled

![German authorities arrested a Libyan man linked to ISIS for plotting an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Berlin](/images/attempt-to-attack-israeli-embassy-in-berlin-IyMz.webp)

German authorities detained a Libyan man with alleged connections to the Islamic State for [plotting an attack](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-police-arrest-man-over-israeli-embassy-attack-plot/a-70544628) on the Israeli Embassy in Berlin. He was arrested in a raid near the capital and is suspected of planning a high-profile attack using firearms. The plot was uncovered with the help of foreign intelligence, and the suspect, identified as Omar A, was reportedly in communication with an IS member through a messenger app. He was preparing to escape to Sankt Augustin after the attack.

The arrest has brought concerns about the growing uptick in [anti-Semitic violence](https://www.politico.eu/article/sharp-rise-in-antisemitic-incidents-recorded-in-germany-october-7/) in Germany, with the Justice and Interior Ministers emphasizing the importance of [protecting Israeli and Jewish](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/schwerpunkte/EN/gegen-antisemitismus-en/gg-as-artikel-en.html) institutions. Israeli Ambassador Ron Prosor thanked the German authorities for ensuring the safety of the Israeli Embassy in Berlin.

### Cuba Goes Dark

Cuba had its second [nationwide blackout](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/19/americas/cuba-second-nationwide-blackout-intl/index.html) on Saturday, just hours after partial power restoration. Millions are without electricity as the island's aging grid continues to fail, disrupting water supplies and increasing the risk of food spoilage amid an [ongoing crisis.](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158380/cuba-power-outage-electricity-embargo)

Officials cite U.S. sanctions, hurricane damage, and outdated infrastructure as key factors contributing to the situation. Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz halted economic activities to prioritize residential power. Healthcare facilities rely on backup generators, while the government has implemented energy-saving measures, including school closures and work restrictions, to manage the limited supply effectively. To make matters worse, [Hurricane Oscar](https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/hurricanes/hurricane-oscar-forms-bahamas-rcna176239) hit Cuba’s Northeastern coast Sunday evening.

### Musk’s $1M Voter Plan

![Elon Musk’s America PAC offers $1M daily to Pennsylvania voters in a controversial bid](/images/musk-plans-to-give-1m-daily-to-pennsylvania-voters-QyNz.webp)

Elon Musk recently unveiled an initiative to distribute [$1 million](https://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk-offers-1m-daily-prize-to-voters-who-sign-petition/a-70546787) daily to a randomly selected registered voter in Pennsylvania until the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The intention is to gather support for Donald Trump. Musk’s campaign group, [America PAC](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/america-pac/), is behind the initiative. It draws from individuals who sign a petition advocating for constitutional rights, mainly free speech and the right to bear arms.

Previously, Musk offered an incentive of[ $100 to every voter](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-offers-pennsylvania-voters-100-sign-donald-trump-petition-presidential-election-1971021) who joined the petition. The initiative is crafted to motivate Trump supporters in crucial swing states, where their votes might significantly influence the election outcome. Musk has given [$75 million to Trump’s campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/g-s1-28591/elon-musk-donald-trump-america-pac-fec) so far and hopes to rally over a million supporters. The initiative has been met with substantial backlash. Legal concerns are being raised, as federal law explicitly prohibits financial incentives for voting. While Musk's payments are directed at individuals signing a petition rather than directly for their votes, [legal experts](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/20/us-election-legal-experts-question-elon-musks-planned-cash-giveaways) still call some of this into question.
