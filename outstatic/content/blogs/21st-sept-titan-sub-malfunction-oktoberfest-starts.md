### Titan Sub Broke Days Before Dive

A public inquiry into the deadly implosion of the Titan submersible, which killed all five aboard during a 2023 expedition to the Titanic wreck, [revealed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70w81ly299o) that the sub had malfunctioned just days before the fatal dive. OceanGate's former scientific director, Steven Ross, testified that the malfunction caused passengers to be thrown around, with one left hanging upside down.

Ross wasn’t sure if the sub’s hull had been inspected for damage afterward. Renata Rojas, a volunteer, recalled the passengers departing happily but noted the tense moments when communication was lost during the dive. The inquiry has since raised concerns about the sub’s safety, design, and the materials used in its construction. In addition to this revelation, the US Coast Guard released [new footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg2qTQEkTOk) of the wreckage site.

### Oktoberfest Kicks Off Today

[Oktoberfest](https://www.oktoberfest.de/en), the world's largest folk festival in Munich, kicks off today.

This year, Oktoberfest is enhancing its inclusivity efforts by introducing a virtual experience for children with disabilities and launching campaigns to combat harassment and promote respectful behavior, addressing past complaints about misconduct. The festival aims to create a safer, greener, and more welcoming environment for everyone, demonstrating that cherished traditions can evolve into modern values.

### The US Uncommitted Movement Won’t Formally Endorse Harris

Leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement, which emerged from Democratic opposition to President Biden's policies on Israel and Gaza, have chosen [not to endorse](https://x.com/uncommittedmvmt/status/1836760479517270218) Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Instead, they urge supporters to "vote against" former President Donald Trump and "avoid" third-party candidates.

Although this position may seem to support Harris indirectly, a co-founder expressed that she has yet to adopt a new strategy, making an official endorsement unsuitable. Many supporters feel disillusioned by her stance on the conflict and are still frustrated by the absence of a Palestinian-American speaker at the Democratic National Convention. Meanwhile, Harris's campaign emphasizes her commitment to efforts to resolve the conflict.

### EU Commission Pledges Billions in Aid for Flood Relief

In Wroclaw, Poland, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the European Union will allocate 10 billion EUR to aid regions impacted by devastating floods. This funding will come directly from the European Solidarity Fund in a cohesion fund and will not require co-financing. The money will first go to the most urgent repairs.

Central Europe has faced its worst [floods](https://apnews.com/article/central-europe-floods-poland-wroclaw-oder-czech-c7b9901872be8706baca1d662098bde9) in over two decades, causing widespread damage across Romania and Poland. The disaster has resulted in at least 24 fatalities, destroyed bridges, submerged vehicles, and left towns inundated with mud and debris. Professionals have been mobilized across Central Europe to enhance relief efforts.

### Bernie Sanders Moves to Block US Arms Sales to Israel

U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is drafting resolutions to block a $20 billion arms sale to Israel. While these resolutions are unlikely to pass in the Senate, they could still send a strong message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and some elements may attract support.

Though congressional support for Israel remains largely bipartisan, public opinion in the U.S. is more divided, particularly over the ongoing [Israel-Gaza conflict](https://apnews.com/article/us-un-israel-hamas-war-gaza-c28906d65480c177b641a8e6676e80fe). Many Americans across the political spectrum are calling for reduced U.S. financial aid to Israel, citing a variety of reasons. Some for humanitarian concerns, while others, including those generally supportive of Israel, point to economic reasons for curbing involvement.
