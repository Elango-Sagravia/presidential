### Trump's Tax Cut Plan Could Add $4 Trillion to Debt

Former President Donald J. Trump’s campaign promises include substantial new tax cuts, projected to add nearly $4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to independent analyses. His plans involve eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, and extending previous tax cuts. Despite proposed new tariffs and repealing tax breaks for clean-energy technologies, which could raise about $3 trillion, Trump’s net revenue loss would still be about $4 trillion, factoring in interest costs.

In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, has not detailed specific tax or spending proposals. Her campaign indicates that her fiscal plans will be aligned with President Biden’s recent budget proposal, which aims to reduce deficits by about $3 trillion over ten years through increased taxes on corporations and high earners. Total federal debt stands at approximately $35 trillion, up from $20 trillion when Trump took office in 2017, growing by $7.8 trillion under Trump and $7.3 trillion under Biden. The Congressional Budget Office projects a $22 trillion debt increase over the next decade, driven by retiring baby boomers and existing policies.

### 2024 Set to Be Hottest Year on Record

This year is shaping up to be the hottest on record, even surpassing the scorching temperatures of 2023. July was a particularly brutal month, with two days claiming the title of hottest ever recorded. The overall heat wave impacted millions across the U.S., and ocean temperatures were also dangerously high. These extreme conditions fueled the early development of Hurricane Beryl into a Category 5 storm and intensified Hurricane Debby.

The developing La Niña weather pattern could further escalate hurricane activity. Meanwhile, sea ice levels in both the Arctic and Antarctic plummeted to record lows. This dramatic loss of ice is directly linked to rising surface temperatures, creating a vicious cycle that intensifies extreme weather events.

### Rising Fatalities at Grand Canyon Amid Heat

Rangers at Grand Canyon National Park are investigating the death of 20-year-old Leticia Castillo, found 150 feet below a South Rim overlook. This marks the third fatality at the park since July 31. Previously, a BASE jumper died after a parachute failure near Yavapai Point, and Indiana student Abel Mejia fell to his death near an overlook.

The Grand Canyon has seen a concerning 11 deaths this year, with hiking being the primary cause of fatalities in previous years. Summer conditions and increased visitor numbers contribute to heightened risks in the park.

### NASA Slams Boeing for Space Launch Failures

A new report from NASA’s watchdog has raised serious concerns about Boeing’s performance on the Space Launch System (SLS), the backbone of NASA’s moon mission. The report slams the aerospace giant for a host of issues, including poor quality control, an inexperienced workforce, and significant cost overruns.

The upper stage of the rocket, built by Boeing, has seen its price tag balloon from nearly a billion dollars in 2017 to a projected $2.8 billion by 2025. To make matters worse, delivery has been pushed back from 2021 to 2027. Despite repeated quality control issues, highlighted by 71 corrective action requests ignored by Boeing, NASA has surprisingly opted against imposing financial penalties.

These problems come as no surprise given the troubled history of Boeing's Starliner capsule, which has faced multiple setbacks, including a critical helium leak during a crewed mission. The overall Artemis program, encompassing the SLS and Orion spacecraft, has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with a price tag exceeding $42 billion to date.

### New Housing Policy for Disabled Veterans

On Thursday, the federal government updated a policy that previously excluded some disabled veterans from receiving subsidized housing. The new policy raises the income threshold for eligibility in the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) supportive housing program. Previously, veterans receiving full disability benefits were disqualified because their benefits were considered income.

Veterans advocates have long criticized the old policy, arguing it exacerbated homelessness among veterans. The change comes amid a 7% rise in veteran homelessness, with notable issues in Los Angeles, home to a large veteran homeless population.

HUD also announced $20 million in funding to enhance supportive housing. This policy shift follows ongoing legal battles and advocacy efforts, including a 2022 federal complaint and a 2011 ACLU lawsuit demanding more housing development at the Los Angeles VA campus. VA officials and local leaders support the change as a crucial step toward ending veteran homelessness.

### **Man Sentenced for Threats to Rep. Swalwell**

Michael Shapiro, 73, was sentenced to two years in prison this week for threatening Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., and his children. Shapiro, who left threatening voicemails at Swalwell’s office on December 19, 2023, was arrested in January and pleaded guilty to transmitting threatening communications in May.

His defense argued the threats occurred during a drunken episode, but prosecutors highlighted Shapiro’s history of similar threats, including against U.S. Capitol Police and another representative. Shapiro had previously been sentenced to probation in 2019 for similar offenses.

### Editorial Criticizes FDA on Food Additives

An editorial in the American Journal of Public Health has criticized the FDA for its lax approach to regulating food additives. The authors specifically point to the use of the GRAS designation, which allows companies to add ingredients without FDA approval, as a major problem. They argue this has led to dangerous substances ending up in our food, citing examples like brominated vegetable oil and excessive caffeine in energy drinks.

Jennifer Pomeranz, the lead author, is calling for a complete overhaul of the FDA's system and more funding for ingredient oversight. While some defend the FDA's work, there's growing support for stricter premarket reviews to guarantee food safety.

### **Denver Officers Fired for Disturbing Messages**

Three Denver police officers – Rodrigo Basurto, Meagan Joy, and Scot Persichette – have been fired for sharing shocking messages in a group chat. The messages, sent on March 27, joked about using newcomer shelters for target practice. The Denver Police Department launched an investigation in April after discovering the messages.

The officers were fired last month, and their actions were reported to the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training unit. The department strongly condemned the messages, calling them completely against their values and disrespectful. The officers were still new to the job, and attempts to contact them for comment were unsuccessful.

### **McLaughlin-Levrone Breaks 400m Hurdles Record**

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, at just 25, absolutely dominated the 400-meter hurdles at the Paris Olympics, smashing her own world record with a stunning time of 50.37 seconds. Easily beating her main rival, Femke Bol from the Netherlands, and securing her third Olympic gold, McLaughlin-Levrone has cemented her place as the queen of the hurdles.

Despite her incredible victory, the perfectionist athlete expressed a hint of disappointment with her record time, identifying areas for improvement. Known for her meticulous training, she has consistently pushed the boundaries of her sport, breaking her own world record multiple times since 2021. This latest win extends her unbeaten streak to an impressive 25 races, solidifying her extraordinary status in athletics.
