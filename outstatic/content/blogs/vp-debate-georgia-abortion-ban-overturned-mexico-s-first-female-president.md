### VP Candidates Face Off

On Tuesday, the vice-presidential debate between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz presented voters with key policy differences. The debate remained largely civil, with both candidates focusing on immigration and abortion. Vance criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for weak border policies, emphasizing the need for stronger immigration enforcement. Walz, in turn, challenged former President Donald Trump’s record on abortion, defending reproductive rights.

The debate highlighted the significant divide between the two campaigns. Immigration policy became a focal point, with Walz accusing Vance of perpetuating inflammatory rhetoric regarding immigrants. Vance responded by focusing on border security. On abortion, Walz advocated for protecting abortion rights, while Vance promoted pro-family policies, signaling a clash over how the issue will shape the 2024 election.

### Georgia Overturns Controversial Six-Week Abortion Ban

A Georgia judge struck down the state’s six-week abortion ban, ruling it [unconstitutional](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/georgia-abortion-ban/index.html). Judge Robert McBurney declared that the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act infringed on women’s state constitutional rights, stating that abortion restrictions before fetal viability violate liberty and privacy rights. The ruling may allow greater access to abortion in Georgia and neighboring states, though the state plans to appeal.

Georgia's ban has heavily curbed the number of abortions since it took effect in 2022 after the overturning of U.S. Supreme Court [Roe v. Wade](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54513499). Governor Brian Kemp criticized the decision, while reproductive rights advocates celebrated it as a victory for bodily autonomy.

### Mexico Swears in First Female President

Claudia Sheinbaum has become [Mexico’s first female president](https://theconversation.com/as-mexicos-new-president-takes-office-a-renewed-battle-to-contain-cartel-violence-begins-239972), taking the reigns of Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Amlo), and now faces the challenge of curbing the country’s rampant violence. The 2024 election season was Mexico’s deadliest, with numerous candidates and party members assassinated. Currently, a violent [gang war in Sinaloa](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/9/27/civil-war-in-the-home-of-mexicos-sinaloa-cartel-fear-grips-culiacan) involving imprisoned cartel leaders has taken over 90 lives.

Sheinbaum successfully reduced crime during her tenure as Mexico City’s mayor. She is expected to continue Amlo’s pacifistic policies but must address the influence of the corruption cartel and improve job opportunities for vulnerable youth. Many are unsure if she can replicate her city-level success nationally, where cartel violence continues to dominate headlines.

A Haitian advocacy group, the [Haitian Bridge Alliance](https://haitianbridgealliance.org/), has filed charges against former President Donald Trump and Senator JD Vance for allegedly spreading false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. [The charges](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/haitian-group-springfield-files-criminal-charges-trump-vance-false-pet-rcna172555), filed under Ohio law, accuse Trump and Vance of making false statements that stirred fear and division within the community. The claims include allegations that Haitian immigrants were harming local animals, [a rumor](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-fringe-online-claim-immigrants-eating-pets-debate-trump-rcna170759) that the advocacy group says is baseless and harmful.

While Ohio law allows private citizens to file criminal charges, a court hearing is required before the case can proceed. The charges against Trump and Vance include disrupting public services and making false alarms. This legal action comes as Trump faces multiple court cases ahead of the 2024 election.

### French Court Tries Rwandan Doctor for Genocide

Eugene Rwamucyo, a 65-year-old former doctor, commenced his [trial in France](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241001-rwandan-doctor-trial-france-genocide) on Tuesday over his alleged involvement in the horrific Rwandan genocide back in 1994. He's facing serious charges, including genocide and crimes against humanity, for supposedly spreading anti-Tutsi propaganda and participating in mass murders to cover up the atrocities.

After leaving Rwanda, Rwamucyo worked as a doctor in France and Belgium. This case is the eighth trial in France related to the genocide, where around 800,000 Tutsis were killed. If convicted, he could spend life in prison. His lawyer maintains that his client was just trying to avoid a health crisis by burying bodies and denies the allegations, claiming they're rooted in his opposition to the current Rwandan government. The trial is set to run until October 29, with about 60 witnesses expected to testify.
