![Swedish authorities investigate a shooting near Elbit Systems in Gothenburg, arresting a 13-year-old suspect](/images/shooting-in-sweden-at-an-israeli-defense-contractor-A0ND.webp)

Swedish authorities are launching an investigation into a [shooting incident](https://www.dw.com/en/sweden-police-investigate-shooting-near-israeli-target/a-70453656) that occurred near the premises of Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems in Gothenburg. Although there were no reported injuries, a young suspect, believed to be as young as 13, was apprehended at the scene. The investigation contains charges of attempted murder and aggravated weapons-related offenses. 

Bomb squad personnel were on the scene to deal with a suspected hazardous object. This incident comes in the wake of a series of security threats directed at Israeli interests in Sweden amidst the broader Israel-Hamas conflict, including previous instances of explosives and [assaults on Israeli embassies](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/02/danish-police-investigate-two-explosions-near-israeli-embassy_6727953_4.html) in Sweden and Denmark.

### Trump Declines Debate Rematch with Harris

Donald Trump officially [declined a second presidential debate](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/09/trump-harris-debate-no-rematch-00183179) with Kamala Harris. He felt it wasn’t necessary, citing the late stage of the election process and the fact that early voting had already begun. Trump also stated that Harris would not deviate from Biden’s policies. This came after Harris proposed an [October 23 debate on CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/21/politics/presidential-debate-harris-trump-cnn/index.html), and Fox News also offered to host another debate later in the month. 

Trump mentioned that while Harris had agreed to an ABC News debate in September, she did not accept Fox’s invitation to earlier debates in the month. Both candidates’ running mates, J.D. Vance for Republicans and Tim Walz for Democrats, [debated on October 1](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/vp-debate-georgia-abortion-ban-overturned-mexico-s-first-female-president). Fox News made a final offer for a debate in late October, but it seems the presidential race will proceed without another confrontation between the top contenders.

### Tesla Unveils New RoboTaxi Model

![Tesla unveils the Cybercab, an autonomous vehicle priced under $30,000](/images/tesla-robotaxi-revealed-AxMj.webp)

Tesla unveiled its Cybercab, a smaller, sleeker version of the Cybertruck, at the “We, Robot” event held at Warner Bros. Discovery studio. CEO Elon Musk introduced a lineup of 20 fully autonomous vehicles, reiterating that the Cybercab would [cost under $30,000](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/10/tesla-reveals-20-cybercabs-at-we-robot-event/) and operate at just $0.20 per mile, making it an affordable alternative for personalized mass transit.

The Cybercab, featuring inductive charging and no steering wheel or pedals, is expected to begin production by 2026. Musk also discussed the progress of Tesla’s [Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology](https://apnews.com/article/tesla-musk-self-driving-analyst-automated-traffic-a4cc507d36bd28b6428143fea80278ce), predicting unsupervised operation in Texas and California next year. Tesla’s RoboTaxi network will allow owners to add their vehicles to the fleet, similar to Uber. However, Cybercab still faces regulatory hurdles, including compliance with safety approvals and federal vehicle safety laws.

### Messaging Apps Used for Political Propaganda

A new report shows how messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Viber are used for political propaganda. Researchers from New York University surveyed 4,500 users across nine countries and interviewed political strategists from 17 countries. They found that 62% of users had seen [political content on these platforms](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/10/report-shows-how-messaging-apps-are-used-to-spread-political-propaganda), with over half coming from unknown sources.

The report pointed out that these apps don't have the usual ways of controlling what's posted, and their paid features let political groups reach many people and spread false information. In response, the report suggests making it harder for business accounts to join and changing the rules to control encrypted platforms while still keeping the benefits of encryption for activists and human rights supporters.
