![](/images/elections1-20-U2OD.webp)

Donald Trump has [secured the keys](https://apnews.com/live/trump-harris-election-updates-11-5-2024) to the White House. He has taken Wisconsin and Pennslyvania, the two states that made up the “[blue wall](https://www.business-standard.com/external-affairs-defence-security/news/us-presidential-poll-terms-like-electoral-college-blue-wall-explained-124110501320_1.html)” Harris would have needed to secure the White House. He is the first politician since the late [1800s](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/11/02/grover-cleveland-the-only-former-us-president-to-make-a-successful-comeback_6731366_4.html) to lose re-election and later mount a successful run. He won nearly every single demographic except Black and Jewish voters.

Kamala Harris officially [conceded](https://www.dw.com/en/us-election-result-donald-trump-wins-over-kamala-harris-v2/live-70708290) to Republican Donald Trump in a [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUouF8oDbs) at Howard University on Wednesday. In it, she thanked her supporters and urged them to continue their efforts to bring about change. Trump also won the popular vote, becoming the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004. Trump [celebrated](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181584/trump-celebrates-historic-win-in-speech) his historic win, promising to usher in a “golden age of America.”

### RECAP

**Oil city**

Neft Daslari, or “Oil Rocks,” is a vast [offshore oil city](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/climate/oil-rocks-neft-daslari-caspian-sea-city/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc) in the Caspian Sea, about 60 miles from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku. This unique structure, built during the Soviet era, is the world’s oldest offshore oil platform and stretches across the sea with a network of oil wells, bridges, and platforms. Throughout the 20th century, [Neft Daslari](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Neft+Da%C5%9Flar%C4%B1,+Azerbaijan/@41.2263442,45.0915273,5.48z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x40302fdb81385615:0x24169709e061efc4!8m2!3d40.2873604!4d50.7204608!16zL20vMGJsbm4y?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) grew into a bustling city with over 5,000 residents. Now, parts of Neft Daslari are crumbling, and environmental concerns such as oil spills and waste discharge into the Caspian are frequent issues. The platform’s fate is uncertain, with options including dismantling, repurposing it as a tourist attraction, or converting it into a museum.

**Math whiz cheating**

Liang Ping, a 17-year-old from rural China, was initially celebrated as a [mathematical prodigy](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87xj8d0131o) after placing 12th in the qualifiers of an international math contest run by Alibaba. Her success story drew attention to show that a vocational school student could compete academically with top university students. However, suspicions soon arose regarding the authenticity of her achievement, with other finalists requesting an investigation and suggesting she seemed unfamiliar with mathematical symbols and concepts. On Sunday, competition organizers revealed that Jiang’s teacher, Wang Runqiu, had assisted her in the preliminary round.

**Liam Payne case**

[Liam Payne](https://apnews.com/article/liam-payne-death-what-to-know-83bd8655c4c70332d4a847b9d167f1fa), former One Direction member, died on October 16 after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. Argentinian prosecutors [charged three individuals](https://apnews.com/article/argentina-payne-death-charged-e73f589a37a4a8f0e80e0b0e71d0f0f4) in connection with his death, including a hotel employee and a suspected drug dealer, accusing them of abandonment leading to death and providing drugs. A toxicology report indicated traces of alcohol, cocaine, and an antidepressant in his system.
