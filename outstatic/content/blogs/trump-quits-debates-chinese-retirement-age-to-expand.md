### Trump Refuses to Do Anymore Debates

Republican nominee Donald Trump said he would not participate in another Thursday presidential debate against Kamala Harris. He wrote on [social media](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-not-participate-another-debate-with-kamala-harris-2024-09-12/), ‘ There will be no third debate!’ He was counting his first debate in June with President Biden when he was still the nominee.

Donald Trump's performance in his debate on Tuesday with Kamala Harris was interesting, to say the least. He claimed to win despite several polls saying Kamala Harris did better. Some of his donors even chalked it up to agreeing that Kamala Harris performed better, but they said it was because Trump could not stay on the topic.

### China Plans To Raise Retirement Age

![China Increases Retirement Age and Its Global Impact](/images/china-raises-retirement-age--it-had-one-of-the-lower-ones-in-the-world--1--A4ND.webp)

China is planning to raise its retirement age for the first time since the [1950s](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62421le4j6o). It plans to implement these changes in January 2025. However, the plan is to gradually raise it by a few months for the next 15 years. China has one of the lowest retirement ages in the world. For women, it is currently 50 for blue-collar jobs and 55 for white-collar jobs. For men, it is 60. Officials want to raise it by 3-5 years.

This decision is based on China’s declining growth rate and an issue with its pension system. The government has said it is due to China's rising life expectancy and living standards. Both cases are likely actual.

### Extreme Weather Alert in Central Europe

Central Europe is bracing itself for flooding and severe weather. Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Germany are highly [alert](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l1l8ng2edo). Forecasters are predicting days of pouring rain that could be catastrophic. In cities such as Prague, they are not taking any chances, as the city was drastically affected by a severe flood about 20 years ago. Countries are putting down sandbags and emptying reservoirs.

This extreme weather rudely interrupted and ended the European summer. Europe went from having a record-breaking summer to a premature fall. Some mountainous areas in Czechia, Slovakia, Australia, and Slovenia reported snowfall earlier this week.

### Boeing Employees Go on Strike

33,000 Boeing factory workers started going on strike on Friday just after midnight after the [International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-strike-machinists-contract-9f61a7d48675d1c3517233d40d4ec2b1) announced that almost 95% of voting workers rejected the proposed contract and 96% approved the work strike, going well over the two-thirds threshold.

The new contract was hailed as one of the most successful in history; however, it wasn’t good enough. They were offered a 25% raise instead of the 40% the union was pushing for. Boeing said it would put another offer on the table. These strikes are just one of the things Boeing has had go wrong for them this year. They were dealing with problems with their passenger jets and failed Dreamliner spaceship.

### Germany Closes Down Islamic Center

German authorities have raided and banned the [Islamic Center Fürstenwalde](https://www.dw.com/en/german-state-bans-islamic-center-over-alleged-hamas-links/a-70202681), located about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Berlin, due to its alleged ties to the militant group Hamas. The raid included searches of multiple properties, including the home of the center's imam. The German government has been cracking down on organizations suspected of supporting extremist activities.

This action comes just days before Brandenburg’s state elections, where the far-right party, known for its anti-Islam stance, is leading in the polls. The closure follows similar actions, including the recent shutdown of an Islamic center in Hamburg, one of Germany's more progressive cities. Authorities have been intensifying efforts to address radicalism across the country.
